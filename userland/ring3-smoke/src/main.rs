//! A minimal freestanding ring-3 smoke test.
//!
//! Not part of the kernel — this is a standalone ELF binary, built by the kernel's `build.rs` and
//! embedded via `include_bytes!`, that the kernel loads and jumps into to prove paging, address
//! space separation, ELF loading, and OxideBSD's native (BSD-style) syscall ABI all actually work.
//! It does a bit of arithmetic (so there's real work for the CPU to have done), writes a success
//! message via `SYS_WRITE`, deliberately triggers an `EBADF` failure to exercise the carry-flag
//! error convention in *both* directions (not just the happy path), then terminates via `SYS_EXIT`
//! with the computed checksum as its exit code.
//!
//! The syscall numbers/vector/register convention here must match `src/syscall.rs` in the kernel
//! exactly — there's no shared crate between the two, this is the ABI boundary itself.
