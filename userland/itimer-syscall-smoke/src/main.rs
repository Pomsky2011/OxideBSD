//! Real-`SYSCALL` smoke test for `SYS_SETITIMER`/`SYS_GETITIMER` (`156`/`157`) -- the syscall
//! that backs both real `setitimer(2)` and real `alarm(2)` (musl's own `alarm()` is a thin
//! wrapper around `setitimer(ITIMER_REAL, ...)`, see `third_party/musl/src/unistd/alarm.c`), and
//! the concrete BusyBox gap this exists to close (`ping`'s own reliance on a real `SIGALRM` to
//! bound its receive loop -- see CLAUDE.md's "BusyBox gap analysis").
//!
//! Deliberately a real spawned ELF driven through genuine `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ`, not a plain Rust
//! function call from a test's own `main()` -- this exact feature depends on the timer IRQ firing
//! correctly across a syscall boundary (`SFMASK` masks `RFLAGS::INTERRUPT_FLAG` for a syscall's
//! entire duration, not just its entry), which is precisely the class of bug CLAUDE.md's "Real
//! networking" section documents finding *only* once tests were converted to this real-`SYSCALL`
//! style (the `hlt()`-in-syscall freeze, and separately the `ticks()`-frozen-during-syscall
//! deadline bug fixed by `src/tsc.rs`). A plain-Rust-function test would have missed both.
//!
//! Two parts, both through `tests/itimer_syscall_smoke.rs` spawning this binary as pid 1:
//! 1. A `setitimer`/`getitimer` round trip in this process itself -- arm a one-shot timer, read
//!    back the remaining time, disarm it, confirm it reads back as fully disarmed.
//! 2. `fork()`, then in the child: arm a short one-shot timer with **no signal handler
//!    installed** (default `SIGALRM` disposition is `Terminate`), and spin in a tight loop of
//!    individually non-blocking `SYS_GETPID` calls -- exactly `ping`'s own real usage pattern (a
//!    tight loop of individually non-blocking `recvfrom` calls, each its own syscall, see
//!    `process::do_setitimer`'s own doc comment). The parent `wait4()`s for the child and checks
//!    the real BSD/Linux wait-status convention (`status & 0x7f == SIGALRM`, matching
//!    `process::terminate_process`'s own `128 + sig` exit-code convention -- see that call site's
//!    doc comment) to confirm the kernel actually killed it, not that the child gave up on its own
//!    time-bounded fallback (which would report as a plain non-signaled exit instead).
//!
//! The syscall numbers/register convention here must match `src/syscall.rs` in the kernel
//! exactly -- there's no shared crate between the two, this is the ABI boundary itself, same as
//! every other `userland/*` crate.
