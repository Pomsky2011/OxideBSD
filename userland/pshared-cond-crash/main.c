/* Isolates the real cross-process pthread_mutex/pthread_cond mechanism from the Open POSIX Test
 * Suite's own `pthread_cond_broadcast/1-2.c` (third_party/posixtestsuite/conformance/interfaces/
 * pthread_cond_broadcast/1-2.c), which genuinely stalled somewhere in its real `fork==1` ("Pshared
 * ... mutex across processes") scenarios during a full pilot run.
 *
 * **Root cause, confirmed via this file**: a real, previously-undiscovered bug in this project's
 * own musl fork (third_party/musl, `oxidebsd` branch) -- not a kernel bug. Real `fork()`
 * (third_party/musl/src/process/fork.c) takes a real `LOCK()` on several internal locks, including
 * stdio's own `ofl_lock` (the "open file list" lock), in the parent *before* the real fork syscall,
 * whenever the process is genuinely multi-threaded (`libc.need_locks > 0` -- true here, since a
 * second real pthread, the timer thread below, already exists). The child therefore inherits
 * `ofl_lock` in a real, genuinely *locked* state. But `_Fork.c`'s own `reset_stdio_locks_in_child`
 * (an earlier fix for a *different* permanent hang, `fork/11-1.c` -- see that function's own doc
 * comment) unconditionally calls `__ofl_lock()` again to safely walk the open-FILE list -- which
 * tries to *re-acquire the exact same lock the child just inherited as held*, deadlocking the
 * child's own sole surviving thread forever (fork()'s own later child-side cleanup, which *would*
 * reset this lock, never gets the chance to run first). Only reproduces with **two or more** real
 * forked children *and* a real second thread already running in the parent at fork time -- one
 * child alone never contends the mutex enough to matter, and without a second thread,
 * `libc.need_locks` never becomes true, so `fork()`'s own pre-fork lock loop never runs at all.
 * Fixed on the musl side (`_Fork.c`'s own doc comment has the fix).
 *
 * Mechanism, matching the real test's own scenario index 8 ("Pshared default mutex across
 * processes") closely enough to reproduce the same real interaction:
 *  1. Real pthread_mutex_t + pthread_cond_t + sem_t in a real file-backed `MAP_SHARED` region
 *     (same `mkstemp("/tmp/...")` + `write` + `mmap` + `unlink` shape the real test uses).
 *  2. Both attrs get real `pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED)`/
 *     `pthread_condattr_setpshared(PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED)`.
 *  3. A real background timer thread starts (present throughout the real test as its own
 *     userspace rescue-timeout mechanism) and blocks on a real `sem_wait`.
 *  4. `fork()`s `N_CHILDREN` real children. Each locks the mutex, increments a shared counter,
 *     `pthread_cond_wait()`s (real, blocking, cross-process) until the parent sets a predicate,
 *     then unlocks and exits.
 *  5. The parent real-busy-polls (lock/read count/unlock/`sched_yield()`, the real test's own
 *     "Make sure all children are waiting" shape) until *all* children have been counted, posts
 *     the timer thread's semaphore, then locks, sets the predicate, real
 *     `pthread_cond_broadcast()`s, unlocks, and `waitpid()`s each child in turn.
 *
 * `N_CHILDREN` is deliberately small (not the real test's own `MAX_PROCESS_CHILDREN = 200`) to
 * keep a single run fast while still exercising real multi-child pshared contention.
