//! Real-`SYSCALL` regression test for the `yes | head` OOM panic (see CLAUDE.md's BusyBox
//! section and `src/pipe.rs`'s module doc comment): a pipe write end used to be an unboundedly
//! growable `VecDeque<u8>`, so a producer that outpaced its consumer -- or, as here, has no
//! consumer draining fast enough -- could grow the kernel heap without limit until the allocator
//! itself panicked. `src/pipe.rs` now bounds the buffer and blocks a full writer for real.
//!
//! Forks: the child writes a single, real `write()` call far larger than the pipe's own capacity
//! (`PIPE_CAPACITY_HINT` below, matching `src/pipe.rs`'s `PIPE_CAPACITY`) into the write end, which
//! only completes once the parent has drained enough space across several read() calls --
//! exercising both new `BlockReason::WaitingForPipeSpace` (the writer blocking) and the existing
//! `WaitingForPipeData`/wake-on-read path together. The parent verifies every byte arrives, in
//! order, unmodified (a repeating `i % 251` pattern), and that the child's own `write()` reports
//! the full length back -- proving the kernel-side partial-write-then-block loop in
//! `src/pipe.rs::write_into` hands the *whole* buffer back to a blocking caller, matching a real
//! blocking pipe write's contract.
//!
//! The syscall numbers/register convention here must match `src/syscall.rs` in the kernel
//! exactly -- there's no shared crate between the two, this is the ABI boundary itself, same as
//! every other `userland/*` crate.
