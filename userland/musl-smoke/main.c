/* A minimal test of a real, unmodified-above-the-syscall-layer musl static binary running under
 * OxideBSD's own native ABI (see the OxideBSD tree's src/syscall.rs / third_party/musl's
 * "oxidebsd" branch). printf() exercises musl's TLS setup (SYS_SET_FS_BASE), its allocator
 * (SYS_MMAP/SYS_BRK), and stdio's own isatty-style probing (SYS_ioctl, expected to fail cleanly
 * until implemented) -- not just a bare write()+exit() the way userland/ring3-smoke/ already
 * proves the syscall mechanism itself works. Returning 0 from main() (rather than calling _exit()
 * directly) exercises musl's real teardown path through exit()/_Exit(), not a shortcut around it. */
