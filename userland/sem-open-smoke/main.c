/* Real cross-process named POSIX semaphore coordination via sem_open()+fork() -- the scenario
 * `process::limits::futex_key` (src/process/limits.rs) exists to make actually work. Real
 * `sem_open()` (third_party/musl/src/thread/sem_open.c) backs a named semaphore with a real
 * `mmap(MAP_SHARED, ...)` of a `/dev/shm/<name>` file, `sem_init`'d with `pshared=1` -- which
 * clears musl's own `FUTEX_PRIVATE` bit on every subsequent `sem_wait`/`sem_post`. Two independent
 * processes calling `mmap()` on that same fd each land at their own, generally *different*,
 * virtual address (`NEXT_MMAP_PAGE`, `src/process/mm.rs`'s own bump allocator, is a single counter
 * shared across every process, never reset per caller) -- so a `FUTEX_WAIT`/`FUTEX_WAKE`
 * implementation keyed on bare virtual address can never let this rendezvous actually happen. This
 * is deliberately plain, ordinary C -- no kernel-specific tricks -- matching
 * `userland/pthread-smoke/main.c`'s own "prove real, unmodified musl library code works end to
 * end" approach.
 *
 * Built via `build_sem_open_smoke` in build.rs (same `musl-gcc -static` recipe `build_musl_smoke`/
 * `build_pthread_smoke` already established), seeded into oxfs as `/sem-open-smoke.elf`, and
 * `fork`+`execve`'d by `userland/sem-open-syscall-smoke/` (a small Rust driver, the same shape
 * `userland/pthread-syscall-smoke/` already uses to drive a real musl fixture through a genuine
 * `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ` round trip).
 *
 * The child calls `sem_wait()` immediately after `fork()` returns; the parent calls a real,
 * blocking `usleep()` first (this kernel's own cooperative-round-robin scheduler always switches
 * to the only other ready process across a blocking syscall) before posting -- making it
 * overwhelmingly likely the child has already committed to a real `FUTEX_WAIT` block by the time
 * the parent's `sem_post()`/`FUTEX_WAKE` runs, so this genuinely exercises the cross-process wake
 * path rather than the semaphore's own same-process fast path.
