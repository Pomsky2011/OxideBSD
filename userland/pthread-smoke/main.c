/* OxideBSD's "Real threading" phases 1-5 finish line -- a genuine, unmodified musl
 * pthread_create()/pthread_join() round trip, not a raw syscall(SYS_CLONE, ...) test (see
 * userland/clone-syscall-smoke/ for the kernel-primitive-only proof this builds on). Deliberately
 * plain, ordinary C code -- no kernel-specific tricks anywhere in this file -- since the entire
 * point is proving real musl thread-library code, completely unaware it's running on OxideBSD,
 * works end to end: a second thread genuinely runs on its own musl-managed stack, shares the first
 * thread's own memory (real CLONE_VM), and joins back cleanly through musl's own real futex-based
 * pthread_join (CLONE_THREAD + futex, phases 2/3) -- including musl's own thread return-value
 * propagation, which `clone-syscall-smoke`'s raw-syscall test has no equivalent for at all (there is
 * no "thread return value" concept below the pthread_join API layer).
 *
 * Built via `build_pthread_smoke` in build.rs (same `musl-gcc -static` recipe `build_musl_smoke`
 * already established for `userland/musl-smoke/`, against the existing static sysroot -- no need
 * for `build_musl_sysroot_shared`'s separate -fPIC build; threading needs no dynamic linking),
 * seeded into oxfs as `/pthread-smoke.elf`, and `fork`+`execve`'d by
 * `userland/pthread-syscall-smoke/` (a small Rust driver, the same shape
 * `userland/dynlink-syscall-smoke/` already uses to drive a real musl fixture through a genuine
 * `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ` round trip).
