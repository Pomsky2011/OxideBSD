//! Real-`SYSCALL` smoke test for `SYS_CLONE = 555` (`process::lifecycle::do_clone`) -- "Real
//! threading" phases 4+5's own finish-line-adjacent verification (before the real
//! `pthread_create`/`pthread_join` crate, `userland/pthread-syscall-smoke/`, which drives the same
//! underlying kernel primitive through genuine, unmodified musl thread-library code instead).
//!
//! A raw `syscall(SYS_CLONE, flags, newsp, ptid, tls)` call, deliberately bypassing musl's own
//! `__clone` asm/`pthread_create` entirely -- same "prove the kernel primitive first" spirit every
//! other `SYS_TEST_*`-scripted smoke test in this codebase already uses. **No musl involved** --
//! this crate is a bare `#![no_std]` binary with its own hand-rolled `syscall()` helpers, the same
//! convention `userland/pause-syscall-smoke/` and friends already establish.
//!
//! **Why the child needs a real asm trampoline, not just "keep running the same compiled code
//! after the syscall returns"**: unlike `fork()`, whose child resumes on a byte-for-byte copy of
//! the parent's own stack (same addresses, same values -- `AddressSpace::fork`'s real eager copy),
//! `clone()`'s child resumes with `RSP` set to the real, separate `newsp` argument
//! (`do_clone`/`context_switch::seed_clone_frame`). Any code compiled to reference a stack slot
//! relative to `_start()`'s own prologue (established against the *parent's* original stack) would
//! read garbage the instant the child's `RSP` pointed somewhere else. `clone_thread` below fixes
//! this exactly the way real `clone.s` does: the syscall's own inline asm branches the child path
//! directly into a real `call` instruction (`call r9`, `r9` = the address of `child_main`,
//! preserved across the syscall the same way musl's own asm preserves its function-pointer
//! argument) -- a genuine call boundary establishes a fresh, well-defined frame on the new stack,
//! so everything `child_main` does afterward is perfectly ordinary compiled code with no hazard.
//!
//! Scenario, driven entirely by `tests/clone_syscall_smoke.rs` spawning this binary as pid 1:
//! 1. Records the caller's own pid (`PARENT_PID`) and clones with the exact flag combination real
//!    `pthread_create` issues, a real caller-provided stack (`CHILD_STACK`), and a real `ptid`
//!    pointer (`PTID`).
//! 2. The child (`child_main`, entered via the real call-boundary trampoline above) checks that
//!    its own `getpid()` reports the *parent's* pid -- real `CLONE_THREAD` tgid-sharing proof --
//!    writes a known sentinel into `SHARED_VALUE` -- real `CLONE_VM` proof, since both "threads"
//!    share one address space -- then signals completion via a real futex word (`JOIN_FUTEX`,
//!    the exact primitive real `pthread_join` itself is built on) and exits.
//! 3. The parent `FUTEX_WAIT`s on `JOIN_FUTEX` (the same real join mechanism `pthread_join` uses,
//!    proven directly rather than through musl), then checks `PTID` was written with the real
//!    child pid (`CLONE_PARENT_SETTID` proof), `SHARED_VALUE` holds the child's sentinel (`CLONE_VM`
//!    proof), and the child's own `getpid()` check passed (`CLONE_THREAD` proof).
