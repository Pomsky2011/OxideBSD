//! Real-`SYSCALL` smoke test for `modules/oxfs`'s write-through disk persistence (see that
//! crate's own "Real disk persistence" section and `src/ata.rs`). Deliberately a real spawned ELF
//! driven through genuine `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ`, not a plain Rust function call from a test's own
//! `main()` -- the whole reason this pass exists is that `write_block`/`write_inode`/
//! `set_block_used` now call into `src/ata.rs`'s PIO driver on every mutation, and that driver's
//! bounded busy-wait must actually work with `RFLAGS::INTERRUPT_FLAG` masked (real syscall
//! context) -- see CLAUDE.md's own `hlt()`-in-syscall/`ticks()`-frozen-during-syscall history for
//! why this codebase specifically distrusts a plain-Rust-function test for exactly this class of
//! bug.
//!
//! `tests/oxfs_persistence_syscall_smoke.rs` boots with `src/ata.rs`'s data disk attached (a
//! freshly zeroed `target/oxfs_test_disk.img`, so `oxfs`'s `module_init` takes the format-then-
//! flush path -- see that function's own doc comment), then spawns this binary as pid 1. This
//! doesn't (and can't, within one QEMU boot) prove persistence survives an actual reboot -- that's
//! inherently two separate `cargo run` invocations, handed to the user as a manual verification
//! step instead (see the implementation plan's own Verification section). What this *does* prove:
//! a real create+write+close, each step going through the real write-through path with interrupts
//! masked, completes without hanging or corrupting the in-memory read-back.
