//! Real-`SYSCALL` smoke test for two mmap-related fixes made while chasing the Open POSIX Test
//! Suite pilot's own `mmap/11-2.c`/`11-3.c`/`12-1.c` FAILs (see `docs/POSIX_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
//! and `src/process/mm.rs`/`src/cpu/interrupts.rs`/`src/process/fault_trampoline.rs` for the real
//! implementation this exercises):
//!
//! 1. **`mmap/12-1.c`'s own bug, independent of mmap itself**: `open(O_CREAT)` on a brand-new path
//!    defers allocating a real inode/directory entry until the fd's first commit
//!    (`ftruncate`/`fsync`/`close`) -- `unlink()`ing the path *before* that first commit used to
//!    find nothing to remove (no entry exists yet) and silently do nothing, after which the
//!    deferred commit went ahead and inserted the entry anyway, resurrecting a name real POSIX
//!    says must stay gone. Part 1 below reproduces `open -> unlink -> ftruncate -> mmap -> close`
//!    and confirms the path is genuinely unreachable afterward, while the still-open mapping keeps
//!    working.
//! 2. **`mmap/11-2.c`/`11-3.c`'s own real gap**: a reference to a whole page mapped past a
//!    file-backed object's own real, page-rounded extent (but still within the caller's original
//!    `len`) must raise a real `SIGBUS` -- this kernel used to map every requested page
//!    unconditionally (zero-filled), so such a reference just silently succeeded. Fixing it needed
//!    a genuinely new capability this test also exercises: **real signal delivery from a ring-3
//!    page fault at all** (this kernel used to reboot on any such fault, ring-3 or not) -- part 2
//!    proves a real installed handler actually runs with the correct signal number; parts 3/4 prove
//!    the *default*-disposition case (no handler) now cleanly terminates just the one offending
//!    process (`SIGBUS` for the reserved-but-unbacked mmap tail specifically, `SIGSEGV` for an
//!    ordinary wild pointer) instead of rebooting the whole kernel.
//!
//! Parts 2-4 each run inside their own forked child -- a real fault-driven signal is fundamentally
//! disruptive to whichever process it hits (it either terminates the process or hands control to a
//! handler that can't safely "return" to the faulting instruction, see
//! `process::fault_trampoline`'s own module doc comment for why), so each gets an isolated child
//! whose own real exit status (checked via `wait4` back in the parent) is the pass/fail signal,
//! the same fork-and-check-wait4-status shape `userland/sig-syscall-smoke`'s own permission-check
//! parts already establish.
//!
//! **No musl involved** -- this crate is a bare `#![no_std]` binary with its own hand-rolled
//! `syscall()` helper and its own minimal `sigreturn_trampoline` (same convention
//! `userland/pause-syscall-smoke/` already established) -- part 2's handler never actually
//! `sigreturn`s (it calls `SYS_EXIT` directly, matching the real pilot test's own `sigbus_handler`,
//! which calls `exit()` and never returns), but `sigaction`'s own wire format still needs a real,
//! valid `restorer` field.
