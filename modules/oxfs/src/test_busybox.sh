# BusyBox applet self-test -- runs INSIDE OxideBSD, not on the host.
#
# Usage, at the hush prompt:
#   sh /test_busybox.sh
#
# A real POSIX-shell test harness now, not a flat sequence of hand-unrolled PASS/FAIL lines.
# `sh`'s own .config (target/busybox-sh/.config after a real build.rs run) used to have only
# CONFIG_HUSH/HUSH_INTERACTIVE/HUSH_JOB set -- HUSH_IF/HUSH_LOOPS/HUSH_CASE/HUSH_FUNCTIONS/
# HUSH_TICK/HUSH_TEST/... were all off (an `allnoconfig` artifact: it writes an explicit
# "not set" line for every symbol in the whole Kconfig tree up front, so the later `make
# oldconfig` pass -- which only fills in symbols with *no* prior answer -- never got a chance to
# apply hush's real `default y` for any of them). Fixed in `build.rs`'s
# `configure_busybox_single_applet` (see its own doc comment) by flipping those lines directly,
# the same way it already did for `HUSH_INTERACTIVE`/`HUSH_JOB`. This script both exercises real
# applets *and* doubles as the regression check for that fix: the "control flow smoke test"
# section below asserts `if`/`for`/`while`/`until`/`case`/functions/`local`/arithmetic/command
# substitution/brace expansion/`$RANDOM` all actually work, not just that they compiled in.
#
# `check`/`check_status`/`report` (below) accumulate into real `PASS`/`FAIL` shell variables via
# real `$((...))` arithmetic -- no longer marker files (`ok_<name>`/`bad_<name>`) tallied with
# `ls | wc -l` at the end, since that workaround existed only because hush had no working
# arithmetic or persistent variables across... itself (it always ran in one process; the marker
# files were purely a stand-in for a counter that didn't work yet). Most checks now capture a
# real applet's output directly via `$(...)` and compare it to an inline expected string, instead
# of writing both sides out to scratch files and running `cmp` -- real command substitution
# strips all trailing newlines on both the actual and hand-written-expected side uniformly, so a
# plain string comparison is exact without needing a byte-for-byte file compare.
#
# Two real, separate kernel bugs this script (or an earlier version of it) found live, both now
# fixed, still worth remembering here since nothing in `cargo test`/`clippy` would have caught
# either:
#
# 1. `oxidebsd_sys_exit` used to store a userland `exit(code)` value as the `wait4()` status
#    *unshifted*, instead of real `wait(2)`'s actual encoding (`WEXITSTATUS` in bits 8-15, low 7
#    bits zero for a normal exit). Any applet exiting normally with a nonzero code -- extremely
#    common -- had that raw low byte misread by hush's real `WIFSIGNALED`/`WTERMSIG` macros as
#    "terminated by signal N" (`exit(1)` decoded as `SIGHUP`), printing a spurious "Hangup" after
#    nearly any failing command and corrupting later commands in the same session. Fixed at the
#    source (see CLAUDE.md's Process/scheduler section) -- this script no longer needs to work
#    around it at all.
# 2. `oxfs_open` used to always return a read-only fd for a path that already existed, regardless
#    of `O_WRONLY`/`O_RDWR`/`O_APPEND`/`O_TRUNC` -- a file could only ever be written once, for
#    its entire lifetime. An earlier version of *this exact script* found it live (accumulating
#    PASS/FAIL lines into one shared results file via repeated `tee -a` started failing on the
#    second line). Fixed in `oxfs_open`/`oxfs_close` (see CLAUDE.md's Permission model section) --
#    the "overwrite an existing file" / "append to an existing file" checks below are the real
#    regression coverage for that fix, something the old file-per-check design could never have
#    exercised even by accident.
#
# `touch` on a path that already exists now succeeds for real too (`utimensat`'s own real
# existence-check semantics -- see CLAUDE.md's musl-port section: no per-inode timestamp fields
# exist to actually update, but a real `ENOENT`-vs-success distinction is enough to satisfy
# `touch.c`'s own fallback logic either way).
#
# --- Pre-v0.1 roster-wide expansion ---
#
# The original ~40 checks below only touched a small slice of the (then ~300, now 256-applet)
# roster. This pass adds real, asserted coverage for the great majority of the curated roster --
# not just "did it crash," but a known expected output/exit status wherever one can be pinned
# down without depending on wall-clock-sensitive or environment-sensitive formatting. It has NOT
# been run against a real boot yet (writing shell scripts blind, without being able to interact
# with a live hush prompt, is inherently a best-effort exercise) -- if a specific check below
# fails, first suspect the check itself (a flag this minimal `allnoconfig`+single-symbol BusyBox
# build didn't compile in, or an output format assumption that's slightly off) before assuming a
# real kernel regression; report back what actually printed and it'll get corrected.
#
# What's deliberately NOT exercised here, and why, is listed in one place near the bottom of this
# file (search for "NOT EXERCISED") rather than scattered as inline apologies -- daemons that
# would hang the script, real interactive-tty flows already documented elsewhere as manual-QEMU-
# only, anything that would mutate persistent on-disk system state (`/etc/passwd` et al.) in a way
# that would outlive this one test run, and applets needing external state this harness can't
# safely fabricate (no on-target compressor for some decompressors' roundtrip, no real hardware).

# NOT EXERCISED, deliberately, and why:
#
# - `yes` piped into anything: a REAL kernel panic, found live by an earlier version of this exact
#   script (`yes | head -n 3` -> `memory allocation of 67239936 bytes failed`), not a script
#   mistake. Root cause: `src/pipe.rs`'s buffer is an unbounded `VecDeque<u8>` (write() never
#   blocks, so there's no backpressure), and this kernel has no preemptive scheduling (see
#   CLAUDE.md's own "no preemption" gap) -- a process only ever yields the CPU at an explicit
#   blocking point (a blocking syscall calling `scheduler::schedule()`). `yes` calls write() in a
#   tight loop that never blocks, so it never yields, so `head` never gets scheduled to read three
#   lines and exit/close its end of the pipe -- `yes` just keeps winning every scheduling
#   opportunity forever, growing the pipe buffer without limit until the kernel heap allocator
#   fails. This isn't specific to `yes`/`head`: *any* pipeline where a producer's own write() calls
#   never block on their own and outpaces a consumer that would otherwise read only part of the
#   output has the same failure mode. A real fix would need either actual preemptive scheduling or
#   a bounded pipe buffer with a real blocking writer -- a genuine architectural decision, not
#   something to sneak in as part of a test script.
# - daemons that listen/block and would hang this script rather than return: httpd, ftpd, telnetd,
#   inetd, dnsd, tcpsvd, udpsvd, udhcpd, lpd, crond, ntpd.
# - needs a real remote peer or infrastructure this environment doesn't guarantee: nc, netcat,
#   telnet, traceroute, whois, rdate, lpq, lpr, fakeidentd, ssl_client, popmaildir, sendmail,
#   pscan, dhcprelay, dumpleases, dnsdomainname, arping.
# - real interactive-tty flows -- already documented elsewhere in this project as manual-QEMU-only
#   (real Ctrl+C/SIGINT, sulogin/getty tty takeover, password prompts read from /dev/tty directly
#   rather than stdin): login, getty, sulogin, su, cttyhack.
# - would mutate persistent on-disk system files (/etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow) in a way
#   that outlives this one test run and could break real su/login testing afterward: adduser,
#   addgroup, delgroup, passwd, chpasswd, remove_shell (out_name `remove`), envuidgid, setuidgid.
# - dangerous to run unscoped (kills processes matching a pattern, could take out this script's own
#   interpreter or other live processes): killall5, pkill.
# - needs a real interactive/full-screen terminal takeover: vi, hexedit, man, watch, top, less
#   (BusyBox's own non-tty-output fallback behavior for `less` isn't reliable enough to assert).
# - decompression tools with no on-target compressor counterpart in this roster to roundtrip
#   against (unlike gzip/bzip2/lzop, which each provide both directions): unxz, xzcat, unlzma,
#   uncompress, unzip.
# - reads real hardware this kernel doesn't model (see CLAUDE.md's BusyBox gap analysis,
#   NEEDS_HARDWARE): volname, resize, ttysize, hwclock, rtcwake, adjtimex.
# - real destructive power state changes -- would kill the whole QEMU session, no test-exit-code
#   ever gets read: halt, poweroff (SYS_REBOOT's RB_AUTOBOOT path too, though not a listed applet).
# - hardware/proc stats with no meaningful assertion and uncertain real backing on this kernel:
#   lsof, fuser, lspci, lsusb, lsscsi, iostat, mpstat, nmeter, powertop, smemcap, taskset, renice,
#   pmap, dmesg, bootchartd, arp.
# - package-management tools with no real package repository or archive present to act on:
#   dpkg, dpkg_deb, rpm, rpm2cpio.
