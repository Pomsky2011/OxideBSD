# A real POSIX conformance baseline -- runs INSIDE OxideBSD, not on the host.
#
# Usage, at the hush prompt:
#   sh /posix_conformance.sh
#
# See docs/POSIX_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md's own "Verification" section for why this exists: every
# other doc in this tree (docs/MISSING_POSIX_SYSCALLS.md, that checklist itself) is
# self-assessment against a hand-written list. This is a real, independent conformance suite (the
# Open POSIX Test Suite, vendored at third_party/posixtestsuite) actually run against this kernel.
#
# What this script does, for each `relative/path.c` line in `/posix-tests/manifest.txt` (a curated
# pilot subset -- see build.rs's `write_posix_test_manifest` for exactly which files and why; NOT
# the whole suite, which is ~1750 files in `conformance/interfaces` alone):
#   1. Run `/posix-tests/bin/<relative/path.c>` (a real ELF, pre-compiled on the host with
#      `musl-gcc` -- see `write_posix_test_manifest`'s own doc comment for why on-target `tcc`
#      compilation was tried first and abandoned: a real `tcc` GOT/PLT linker bug produced binaries
#      that null-pointer-faulted calling into specific musl functions -- `sigaction`/`fflush`
#      confirmed -- found live investigating exactly this pilot's own early crashes) through
#      `/posix-tests/t0` (the suite's own real timeout-wrapper utility, also pre-compiled) with a
#      real bounded timeout -- load-bearing, not a nicety: this kernel has no preemption, so a test
#      that blocks forever on something genuinely unimplemented (a `sem_wait` that can never wake
#      without real `futex(2)`, say) would otherwise hang this whole script -- and the shell
#      driving it -- permanently. `t0` sets a real `alarm(n)` then `execvp`s the test directly (see
#      its own source comment) -- an expired timeout surfaces as the test dying to an uncaught real
#      `SIGALRM`, which this kernel's own real `wait(2)`-encoded exit status reports as `128 +
#      SIGALRM` (14) = 142 (see CLAUDE.md's process/scheduler section on the real
#      signal-vs-normal-exit status encoding) -- classified below as TIMEOUT, not a crash.
#   2. Classify the real exit status against the suite's own standardized result codes
#      (real POSIX values every pilot binary was built against): PASS(0)/FAIL(1)/UNRESOLVED(2)/
#      UNSUPPORTED(4)/UNTESTED(5), plus this script's own TIMEOUT/CRASH buckets for everything the
#      suite's own convention doesn't cover (a real signal-terminated crash, e.g. a genuine
#      SIGSEGV, is exactly as informative a result as a clean FAIL -- it means something, just not
#      "the assertion itself was checked and failed").

    # 40s, not 5s: nanosleep/10000-1.c alone legitimately sleeps through ~27 real seconds of valid
    # durations (0+1+1+2+10+13s) before it even reaches its invalid-parameter checks -- a real,
    # working nanosleep() genuinely needs that long, not a hang. Found live: an earlier 5s bound

    #
    # A handful of pilot files self-skip (`PTS_UNTESTED`) whenever `getuid() == 0`, since this
    # whole pilot otherwise always runs as root (`su`'s own child, in turn `sh /posix_conformance.sh`,
    # is invoked directly by `posix-conformance-driver`, itself pid 1 -- see that crate's own doc
    # comment). Most such files (`sem_open/3-1.c`, `sigqueue/3-1.c,12-1.c`, `sched_getparam/6-1.c`,
    # `sched_getscheduler/7-1.c`, `sched_setscheduler/20-1.c`, `shm_open/32-1.c,34-1.c`) already call
    # the suite's own `set_nonroot()` helper (`ptsupport`) to drop privilege *themselves* once they
    # detect real uid 0 -- that already works on this kernel (confirmed live: those tests already
    # PASS), so they need nothing from this script. `sched_setparam/26-1.c` is the one exception in
    # this pilot's own corpus: its own hand-written `getuid() == 0` check has no `set_nonroot()`
    # fallback at all -- it just bails `PTS_UNTESTED` unconditionally under root, real assertion
    # never reached. Patching that check into the test itself was deliberately rejected: unlike
    # musl/BusyBox/TinyCC (personal forks on an `oxidebsd` branch, real patches allowed and
    # documented), `third_party/posixtestsuite` is a plain submodule of the real upstream mirror --
    # editing its own test source would quietly narrow what this pilot is actually verifying.
    # Fixed instead from *outside* the test, the same way a real user would run it non-interactively
    # as a regular account: `su`'s own real, already-working root-skips-password path (see CLAUDE.md's
    # "Session, controlling-tty, and login authentication" section) execs a real `/bin/sh -c CMD` as
    # uid 1000 (the seeded `user` account) *before* the test binary itself ever starts, so its own
    # `getuid()` genuinely reads back 1000 -- reaching the real assertion (`sched_setparam(1, ...)`
    # against root-owned pid 1 -- expects `EPERM`) instead of ever hitting the early bailout.
