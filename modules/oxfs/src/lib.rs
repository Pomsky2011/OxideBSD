//! `oxfs`: a small, real Unix-shaped filesystem (inodes with direct + single-indirect block
//! pointers, directories as ordinary inodes holding fixed-size records, real multi-component path
//! resolution, real per-process current-working-directory) -- replacing `modules/fat32` as the
//! filesystem `stsh`/BusyBox actually run on. See `CLAUDE.md`'s oxfs section for the full design
//! rationale; `modules/fat32` is kept in the workspace, still building and self-checking on every
//! `cargo build`, but is no longer loaded at boot.
//!
//! Like `modules/fat32`, this is in-memory only -- no real block device exists yet, so nothing
//! persists across reboot. Unlike FAT32, there's no on-disk *format* to invent or generate at
//! build time at all: `module_init` below populates the inode table directly via ordinary function
//! calls, using content `build.rs` hands this crate's own `include_bytes!(env!(...))` calls (each
//! already-built userland/BusyBox ELF gets its own env var, the same `extra_env` mechanism
//! `FAT32_IMAGE_PATH` already used) or, for the two small text files, a literal and the same
//! `b'A' + i % 26` formula `modules/fat32`'s own self-check already used.
//!
//! **What this fixes relative to FAT32** (see CLAUDE.md's FAT32 section for the full list of
//! limitations this replaces): 8.3 short names -> real names up to `NAME_MAX` bytes; one path
//! component per syscall call -> real multi-component `a/b/c`/`../x`/`/a/b` resolution in one call
//! (`resolve_path`/`resolve_parent` below); a directory that can never grow past its first
//! cluster -> a directory's own inode grows additional blocks like any other file; a fixed
//! per-open-file read cap (`MAX_FILE_BUFFER`, raised three times) -> real files stream straight
//! from their own block chain on each `read()`, capped only by the block pool itself; one
//! kernel-wide current directory shared by every process -> real per-process cwd
//! (`Process::cwd` in `src/process.rs`, via `oxidebsd_get_cwd`/`oxidebsd_set_cwd`); no
//! `unlink`/`rmdir`/`rename` at all -> all three now exist.
//!
//! **Storage**, all fixed-size `static mut` arrays (modules can't use `alloc`/`Vec`/`BTreeMap` --
//! see CLAUDE.md's module-loading section): a flat pool of `NUM_BLOCKS` `BLOCK_SIZE`-byte blocks
//! (`BLOCKS`/`BLOCK_USED`), and a flat table of `MAX_INODES` inodes (`INODES`). An inode holds up
//! to `DIRECT_BLOCKS` block numbers directly plus one single-indirect block (another
//! `BLOCK_SIZE / 4` pointers) -- max file size is bounded only by the block pool, not by an
//! arbitrary per-file cap.
//!
//! **Directories are ordinary inodes** whose data blocks hold fixed 32-byte records
//! (`{ used: u8, name_len: u8, inode: u32, name: [u8; NAME_MAX] }`, `NAME_MAX = 26`) --
//! `RECORDS_PER_BLOCK = BLOCK_SIZE / 32 = 128` entries per block. A directory that fills its
//! current blocks grows another one via the same `inode_ensure_block_at` every other file write
//! uses, rather than failing outright the way FAT32's own `DirectoryFull` did. `unlink`/`rmdir`
//! just clear a record's `used` byte -- the underlying inode/blocks are never freed, matching this
//! codebase's blanket "no deallocation anywhere" policy (`do_munmap`, module unload, etc.).
//!
//! **Root is a fixed inode number (`ROOT_INODE = 0`)**, self-referencing `.`/`..` (root's `..`
//! points at itself) -- no FAT32-style "`0` means root" special-casing needed, since there's no
//! on-disk format to stay compatible with. `ROOT_INODE`'s value (`0`) deliberately coincides with
//! `Process::cwd`'s own default (`0`, "unset") -- a freshly spawned process's cwd is root with no
//! translation needed.
//!
//! **Syscalls registered at the exact numbers `modules/fat32` used** (so nothing else in the ABI
//! changes): `SYS_OPEN = 5`, `SYS_CLOSE = 6`, `SYS_CHDIR = 12`, `SYS_MKDIR = 136`,
//! `SYS_GETCWD = 108`. Plus three new ones, OxideBSD-own-invented numbers continuing from `108`
//! (per this project's own established convention -- syscalls added after the musl/BusyBox port
//! invent their own numbers rather than copying FreeBSD's, see `SYS_GETPPID`/`SYS_GETCWD`/
//! `SYS_PIPE`/`SYS_DUP2`): `SYS_UNLINK = 109`, `SYS_RMDIR = 110`,
//! `SYS_RENAME = 111` (`(old_ptr, old_len, new_ptr, new_len)` -- uses all four of this ABI's
//! argument registers, the same precedent `execve`'s `envp_ptr` set for needing `R10`). Plus
//! `SYS_FSTAT = 126`, `SYS_STAT = 127`, `SYS_LSTAT = 128` (continuing past `SYS_DUP = 125`, the
//! highest number any module had claimed) -- see `write_stat`'s own doc comment for the wire
//! format and what's synthesized vs. real. Plus `SYS_GETDENTS = 129` -- real `readdir()`'s own
//! syscall, see `oxfs_getdents`'s own doc comment for the wire format.
