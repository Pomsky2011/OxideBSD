//! The first, deliberately trivial OxideBSD kernel module — proves the dynamic module loader
//! (`src/module.rs`) can relocate real, independently-compiled code into the running kernel,
//! resolve a call into the kernel's own exported API by name, and invoke `module_init`, before
//! anything more substantial (the native syscall ABI, FAT32) is built on top of it.
//!
//! Not linked with the kernel in any normal sense: this crate is compiled to a standalone
//! relocatable object (see `build.rs`'s `build_module_crate`), merged at build time against the
//! exact `core`/`alloc`/`compiler_builtins` the kernel's own `-Z build-std` produced, and only
//! resolved against the kernel's live symbol table at boot. See `CLAUDE.md`'s module-loading
//! section for the full design.
