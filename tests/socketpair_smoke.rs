//! Smoke test for `SYS_SOCKETPAIR = 149` (`src/pipe.rs`'s `do_socketpair`), `SYS_FCNTL = 151`, and
//! `SYS_SHUTDOWN = 152` -- all added to unblock BusyBox's `wget` HTTPS path (`spawn_ssl_client` in
//! `networking/wget.c` uses a socketpair; `libbb/xfuncs.c`'s `ndelay_on`/`ndelay_off` need real
//! `fcntl`; `wget.c` itself calls `shutdown(fd, SHUT_WR)` on the same kind of endpoint -- see
//! CLAUDE.md's "Real networking" known-gaps entry). Calls the kernel's own FFI-level
//! `oxidebsd_sys_*` entry points directly, same technique `tests/tcp_smoke.rs` already uses -- no
//! module loading or real process needed, since this test never hits `do_socketpair`'s blocking
//! path (see `src/pipe.rs`'s own doc comment: a read only blocks when its buffer is empty *and*
//! still open, and every read here happens once data, a close, or a real `O_NONBLOCK` flag has
//! already made the outcome immediate).
//!
//! Covers: both directions of a full-duplex pair actually reach the peer; closing one end
//! produces real EOF (on the peer's read) and EPIPE (on the peer's write); `fcntl(F_SETFL,
//! O_NONBLOCK)` makes an empty read return real `EAGAIN` instead of blocking (which would hang
//! this whole test, given this kernel is single-core and cooperatively scheduled -- see
//! `src/pipe.rs`'s own doc comment); `shutdown(SHUT_WR)` half-closes just one direction, leaving
//! the other direction of the same pair fully functional.
