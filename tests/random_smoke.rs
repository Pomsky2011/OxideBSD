//! Smoke test for `src/random.rs`'s `oxidebsd_random_bytes` -- the real, SHA-256/ChaCha20-backed
//! random byte source added to unblock BusyBox's vendored TLS code (`networking/tls.c`'s
//! `tls_get_random`, called via `/dev/urandom` -- see CLAUDE.md's "Real networking" known-gaps
//! entry on `wget` HTTPS). Only exercises the kernel-resident generator itself, not `modules/
//! oxfs`'s own `/dev` path routing -- that can only really be driven by a real process actually
//! `open()`ing the path, which needs a full module-loading boot (like `tests/fork_wait.rs`'s own
//! pattern); this covers the new, riskier cryptographic logic this pass actually added instead.
//!
//! Covers: the call doesn't crash for a range of buffer sizes (including `0`, matching this
//! codebase's own established `len == 0` convention elsewhere), two consecutive calls produce
//! genuinely different output (proving this is real per-call entropy, not a fixed or all-zero
//! buffer a stub could also satisfy), and the output isn't a degenerate all-same-byte pattern.
//!
//! Also covers the two later additions to this module -- the persistent `ENTROPY_POOL` and the
//! `RDRAND`/`RDSEED` hypervisor-distrust gate (see `src/random.rs`'s own doc comment) -- neither
//! of which the original assertions above actually exercise: two consecutive
//! `oxidebsd_random_bytes` calls already differ from the monotonic call counter alone, pool or no
//! pool, so "output changed" alone doesn't prove the pool is real. `entropy_pool_snapshot`/
//! `mix_entropy`/`running_under_hypervisor` are all `pub` specifically for this file's use (see
//! their own doc comments in `src/random.rs`).
