//! Smoke test for `SYS_READV = 153` (`src/syscall.rs`'s `sys_readv`) -- added because musl's
//! entire stdio *read* path goes through `readv`, not plain `read`, whenever a `FILE*` has real
//! internal buffering (`third_party/musl/src/stdio/__stdio_read.c`). Found live: BusyBox's `wget`
//! completed a real HTTPS download (the TLS/TCP fix chain all worked, real response bytes came
//! through) and then failed on the very next buffered read -- see CLAUDE.md's "Real networking"
//! known-gaps entry for the full trace.
//!
//! Uses a socketpair as the underlying fd (already-verified plumbing from `tests/
//! socketpair_smoke.rs`) rather than anything readv-specific, since `sys_readv` is just a thin
//! per-iovec loop over the same `sys_read` every other test already exercises.
//!
//! Covers: a single `readv()` call scattering one write's worth of data across two iovecs, and
//! real `readv` short-read semantics (a partially-filled iovec ends the call there, rather than
//! moving on to the next iovec expecting more to somehow still be available).
