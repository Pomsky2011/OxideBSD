//! A minimal ATA PIO (Programmable I/O) disk driver -- classic legacy IDE, LBA28, polling only,
//! no IRQ. See <https://wiki.osdev.org/ATA_PIO_Mode>. This kernel's first real block device.
//!
//! **Polling, not IRQ-driven, deliberately.** PIO is inherently synchronous and CPU-driven (the
//! CPU itself shuttles every word across the data port -- there's no DMA to wait on), and this
//! code must be safely callable from inside a real syscall handler with `RFLAGS::INTERRUPT_FLAG`
//! masked (oxfs's write-through persistence runs on every file write). Any wait here uses
//! `core::hint::spin_loop()` against a `crate::tsc`-based deadline, never `hlt()` -- see
//! `src/tsc.rs`'s own doc comment for why a tick-based wait can never elapse inside a syscall, and
//! CLAUDE.md's "Real networking" section for the `hlt()`-in-syscall freeze this exact mistake
//! caused there.
//!
//! **Legacy fixed ports, no PCI probing.** QEMU's default `i440fx` machine type's PIIX3 IDE
//! controller (and every real PC chipset before it) exposes the primary/secondary channels at
//! fixed, well-known port ranges regardless of PCI enumeration -- 0x1F0-0x1F7/0x3F6 (primary,
//! IRQ14) and 0x170-0x177/0x376 (secondary, IRQ15). Unlike `rtl8139`, there's nothing to discover.
//!
//! **One fixed target: secondary channel, master.** `bootimage` always attaches this kernel's own
//! boot image as `-drive format=raw,file=<image>` with no explicit `if=`, which QEMU resolves to
//! the *primary* IDE master by default -- so the block API below (`oxidebsd_block_*`) targets the
//! secondary channel's master drive specifically, to guarantee it can never be the same device the
//! kernel itself booted from. See `Cargo.toml`'s `run-args`/`test-args` for the matching
//! `-device ide-hd,bus=ide.1,unit=0` pinning.
