//! A minimal driver for the CMOS/MC146818 real-time clock -- the standard PC wall-clock chip,
//! battery-backed and running independently of anything this kernel does. See
//! <https://wiki.osdev.org/CMOS>. Read fresh on every `CLOCK_REALTIME` request
//! (`src/syscall.rs`'s `sys_clock_gettime`) rather than cached at boot: the chip is always there
//! and reading it is cheap, so there's no drift/staleness tradeoff to make the way there would be
//! deriving wall-clock time from `src/pit.rs`'s tick count instead.
//!
//! Known simplifications: doesn't wait out an in-progress RTC update before reading (a real read
//! landing mid-tick can be off by up to a second, extremely rare and self-correcting on the next
//! call -- not worth the standard double-read-until-stable dance for a clock nothing here needs
//! sub-second wall-clock accuracy from) and assumes the 21st century (`year` is `2000 + CMOS
//! year`, no century register read). Sub-second resolution isn't offered at all --
//! `sys_clock_gettime`'s `CLOCK_REALTIME` always reports `tv_nsec = 0`.
