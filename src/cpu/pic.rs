//! A minimal driver for the 8259 (and 8259A) Programmable Interrupt Controller pair. See
//! <https://wiki.osdev.org/8259_PIC>.
//!
//! By default PIC1 maps IRQ0-7 onto interrupt vectors 0x8-0xF and PIC2 maps IRQ8-15 onto
//! 0x70-0x77 (or a chipset-specific alternative) — both overlap CPU exception vectors, so both
//! controllers are reprogrammed here to a contiguous, exception-free range instead.

        // since the LAPIC (not the 8259) is what the CPU actually listens to whenever the LAPIC
        // is enabled at all. Real BIOS/SeaBIOS + the old `bootloader` crate apparently never
        // enabled the LAPIC in the first place, so the CPU fell back to the legacy direct-INTR
        // 8259 path by construction; Limine (or OVMF/SeaBIOS's own more modern, ACPI-aware
        // platform init once Limine hands off through them) leaves it enabled but not configured

        // and no driver for at all -- `cpu::interrupts` is purely 8259-based): disabling the
        // LAPIC outright via `IA32_APIC_BASE`'s global-enable bit makes the CPU treat its `INTR`
        // pin exactly like a pre-APIC system again, restoring direct 8259-to-CPU delivery
