//! Limine boot-protocol glue: the request statics Limine scans for at load time, plus a thin
//! `BootInfo` shim and a `limine_entry_point!` macro that together replace the old `bootloader`
//! crate's `entry_point!(fn) -> fn(&'static BootInfo) -> !` calling convention with a byte-
//! compatible one -- every existing call site across `src/main.rs`/`src/lib.rs`/every
//! `tests/*.rs` file keeps dereferencing `boot_info.physical_memory_offset` unchanged; only the
//! `use`/macro-invocation lines at the top of each file need to change. See CLAUDE.md's boot
//! section for why: Limine's HHDM offset and memory map are direct analogs of the old
//! `bootloader::BootInfo`'s `physical_memory_offset`/`memory_map` fields, and everything
//! downstream of `oxidebsd::init` (GDT/IDT/frame allocator/heap) already treated those two values
//! as the only real inputs from the bootloader.
