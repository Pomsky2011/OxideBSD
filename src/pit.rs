//! A minimal driver for channel 0 of the 8253/8254 Programmable Interval Timer -- the same chip
//! `src/interrupts.rs`'s `TICKS` counter already counts IRQs from, just never reprogrammed away
//! from whatever rate the BIOS happened to leave it at. See <https://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer>.
//!
//! Reprogrammed here to a known, fixed rate instead, so `ticks()` means something precise: real
//! PC BIOSes (including QEMU's SeaBIOS) do leave channel 0 free-running at its power-on default
//! (~18.2065 Hz, divisor 0 meaning 65536) well before this kernel ever runs, which is *why*
//! `TICKS` already worked at all -- but that default was never something this kernel configured,
//! and relying on an unconfirmed implicit rate for real clock arithmetic (`src/syscall.rs`'s
//! `sys_clock_gettime`) would make every `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` reading only as trustworthy as that
//! assumption. `TIMER_HZ = 100` (the traditional old-Linux `HZ` value) is deliberately modest, not
//! the finer 1000 Hz some modern kernels use: this kernel's IRQ handling runs under QEMU's
//! software TCG emulation, where every extra interrupt has real, measured overhead (see
//! `src/memory.rs`'s own doc comment on `invlpg` cost at scale for the same class of concern) --
//! 100 Hz is plenty of resolution for a clock nothing here yet needs sub-10ms precision from.
