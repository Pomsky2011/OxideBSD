///
/// `pub(crate)`, not private: `src/syscall.rs`'s `redirect_frame` (used by `sys_execve`) reuses

/// This is genuinely one-way: `iretq` never returns to its caller here. The kernel only regains
/// control via an interrupt, exception, or syscall (see `src/syscall.rs`) firing while this code
/// runs — and even `SYS_EXIT` doesn't "return" in the traditional sense, since there's still no
/// scheduler to resume anything; it just idles the whole system. See the `ring3-smoke` demo
/// (`userland/ring3-smoke/src/main.rs`) and `src/main.rs`'s `run_ring3_smoke_demo`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The currently-active address space (whatever `CR3` points at) must already have `entry` mapped
/// present + user-accessible + executable, and `user_stack_top` mapped present + user-accessible +
/// writable (both true after `elf::load` and a matching user-stack mapping into the same address
/// space). `gdt::init` must have already run, so `TSS`'s RSP0 is set — without it, the first
/// interrupt or exception that fires while this code is running in ring 3 has nowhere valid to
/// switch to.
