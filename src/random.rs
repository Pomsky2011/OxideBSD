//! A real, cryptographically-mixed random byte source backing `/dev/random`/`/dev/urandom`
//! (`modules/oxfs/`'s synthetic `/dev` -- see that module's own `dev_open`). Every call gathers
//! several independent, hard-for-an-outside-observer-to-predict values (the CPU cycle counter,
//! PIT tick count, RTC wall-clock, a monotonic call counter, a stack address, real hardware
//! `RDRAND`/`RDSEED` output when the CPU supports it, and the persistent entropy pool below),
//! hashes them all together with SHA-256 (RustCrypto's `sha2` crate) into a 32-byte key, then
//! generates the caller's requested output as a ChaCha20 (RustCrypto's `chacha20` crate) keystream
//! under that key -- the same "gather a pile of diverse state, hash it into a seed, drive a real
//! algorithm with it" design Pokemon Black/White's own famous RNG made popular, just with a real
//! stream cipher standing in for that game's own LCG.
//!
//! **`ENTROPY_POOL`: a real, persistent accumulator, distinct from `gather_seed`'s own per-call
//! snapshot.** The original version of this module re-derived everything from scratch on every
//! call -- under QEMU/TCG without `RDRAND` (the common dev-loop case), that leaves the generator
//! with almost nothing genuinely hard to predict: RTC has 1-second granularity, PIT ticks advance
//! at a fixed 100 Hz, the call counter is fully deterministic (its job is uniqueness, not
//! unpredictability), and the stack-address sample is a fixed local, essentially constant call to
//! call. `mix_entropy` folds real, externally-triggered timing jitter -- the exact `RDTSC` value
//! at which a keyboard IRQ or a network-frame IRQ happened to land, both driven by events outside
//! this kernel's own control -- into a small pool on every such interrupt (see the keyboard and
//! rtl8139 IRQ handlers' own call sites). Deliberately *not* fed by the periodic timer tick: a
//! period signal is close to the opposite of an entropy source, and it's the hottest IRQ in the
//! kernel, not worth the added lock traffic. `gather_seed` folds the pool's current state into
//! every output and also re-mixes it with a fresh `RDTSC` sample as part of the same critical
//! section, so the pool keeps evolving even across calls with no intervening IRQ activity --
//! same "generating also perturbs state" reasoning a Fortuna-style generator uses.
//!
//! **No fixed reseed-interval policy** -- unlike real Linux's `/dev/urandom` (a long-lived pool,
//! reseeded on a schedule), every call here derives an independent key from the pool's *current*
//! state plus fresh per-call sources, so there's no interval to get wrong. A fixed, all-zero
//! ChaCha20 nonce is safe specifically *because* of this: the algorithm's real security
//! requirement is "never reuse a `(key, nonce)` pair," and `CALL_COUNTER` (strictly monotonic,
//! folded into every seed) guarantees a freshly derived key is never reused across two different
//! calls, independent of how much real entropy any other source contributed that call.
//!
//! **Crypto primitives are vetted, external crates (`sha2`/`chacha20`), not hand-rolled** --
//! deliberately different from this codebase's usual "own the small stuff" bias (`src/pic.rs`
//! instead of `pic8259`, the hand-written syscall ABI, ...): a subtle bug in a hand-written hash
//! or stream cipher is far harder to catch than one in a driver or allocator, and this is exactly
//! the class of code where "well-audited, widely used implementation" outweighs "we wrote it
//! ourselves," the same reasoning `linked_list_allocator`/the `x86_64` crate already followed.
//!
//! Not a real Linux-style entropy pool with a blocking-until-enough-entropy distinction -- both
//! `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom` share this exact same source, matching modern Linux's own
//! post-5.6 stance that the two barely differ once a pool is initialized. Still an honest gap
//! versus a hardware TRNG: with no `RDRAND`/`RDSEED` and no interrupt activity yet (e.g. the very
//! first read right at boot, before any keystroke or packet has landed), the pool starts at all
//! zeroes and the generator is leaning on the same weak per-call sources as before this pool
//! existed -- this change raises the floor for any *sustained* use, not the very first call.
//!
//! **`RDRAND`/`RDSEED` are only ever trusted on real bare metal, never under a hypervisor.**
//! `CPUID` reporting the instruction as CPU-supported only proves the *physical* CPU has it -- it
//! says nothing about whether the specific hypervisor a guest happens to be running under is
//! passing it through honestly. Both Intel VT-x and AMD SVM expose an execution-control bit
//! ("RDRAND exiting"/"RDSEED exiting") that lets a hypervisor trap either instruction and
//! substitute any value it wants, while the guest still observes a clean success -- there is no
//! way to detect this from inside the guest. `running_under_hypervisor()` checks the standard
//! `CPUID` leaf `1`, `ECX` bit `31` ("hypervisor present," set by every major hypervisor
//! including QEMU/KVM, VMware, Hyper-V, Xen) and `rdrand_available`/`rdseed_available` both treat
//! the instruction as unavailable whenever it's set -- real hardware entropy is only ever used
//! when nothing between this kernel and the physical CPU could be lying about it. Under any
//! detected hypervisor (this project's own QEMU dev/test loop included), the persistent
//! `ENTROPY_POOL`'s IRQ-jitter accumulation above is the real floor instead.
