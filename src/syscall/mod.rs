//! OxideBSD's native syscall ABI: `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ`, syscall number in `RAX`, up to four
//! arguments in `RDI`/`RSI`/`RDX`/`R10`, success/failure signaled via the **carry flag** — the
//! traditional BSD (and general historical x86 Unix) convention, layered on top of the modern
//! fast-syscall instruction pair instead of the legacy `int 0x80` software-interrupt gate this
//! kernel used up through its first process/scheduler milestone. On success, `CF = 0` and `RAX`
//! holds the return value; on failure, `CF = 1` and `RAX` holds the *positive* `errno`. Register
//! placement (`RDI`/`RSI`/`RDX`/`R10`, avoiding `RCX`/`R11` since `SYSCALL` itself clobbers them
//! to save `RIP`/`RFLAGS`) mirrors real BSD's own `SYSCALL`-based convention.
//!
//! **`R10` used to be reserved but unread** — the entry stub always pushed it (uniform GPR
//! save/restore, see `SyscallFrame`'s own doc comment), but `syscall_dispatch`/`dispatch` only
//! ever forwarded `RDI`/`RSI`/`RDX` to a handler. Wired up for real once `SYS_EXECVE` needed a 4th
//! argument (`envp_ptr`, alongside the existing `path_ptr`/`path_len`/`argv_ptr`) to support real
//! `envp` passthrough — see `CLAUDE.md`'s BusyBox section. `SyscallHandler` is now a 4-argument
//! function pointer; every registered handler across every module gained a 4th parameter (ignored
//! by every syscall except `execve`), not just `execve`'s own — a real 4th argument is now a
//! permanent part of this ABI, available to any future syscall that needs one, not a one-off
//! special case threaded through only where `execve` needed it.
//!
//! **This mechanism used to be split across two files**: this module's own `int 0x80` gate, and a
//! separate `src/linux_syscall.rs` that proved the `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ` mechanism in isolation
//! (Linux's numbering, negative-`RAX` error convention — deliberately different from this ABI, as
//! a stepping stone toward eventually running unmodified Linux binaries). That plan changed: this
//! kernel is instead porting musl to speak *this* ABI directly (see `CLAUDE.md`'s "musl" section),
//! so there was no longer a reason to keep two different syscall-numbering/error conventions each
//! tied to a different trap instruction. `IA32_LSTAR` can only point at one entry stub, so this
//! ABI now **owns** the `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ` mechanism outright — `src/linux_syscall.rs` and its
//! dedicated `userland/linux-syscall-smoke/` test are gone, having already served their purpose of
//! proving the mechanism (`IA32_STAR`/`LSTAR`/`SFMASK` setup, the GDT segment-ordering
//! requirement, the stack-switch-on-entry problem) works at all.
//!
//! Syscall numbers match real FreeBSD's long-stable values for the calls implemented so far, as a
//! deliberate nod to authenticity — not a claim of binary compatibility with real BSD userland
//! (newer syscalls this ABI invents for itself, e.g. `mmap`/`brk`/TLS-base-set, don't extend that
//! convention — see `modules/native_abi/`). errno values are *mostly* shared across Linux and the
//! BSDs (`EBADF`, `EINVAL` are identical), but not universally — `ENOSYS` is `38` on Linux, `78` on
//! FreeBSD. **`ENOSYS` itself uses the Linux/musl value (`38`), not the FreeBSD one** — the one
//! deliberate exception to this file's own "FreeBSD authenticity" framing, fixed after it was found
//! live blocking real functionality: whatever this file returns via the carry-flag ABI becomes
//! musl's raw `errno` directly (see `EPROTONOSUPPORT`'s own doc comment below for the full
//! mechanism), so a FreeBSD-authentic-but-musl-wrong value here isn't just cosmetic — BusyBox's own
//! `libbb/change_identity.c` has a real upstream fallback (`errno == ENOSYS && target_uid ==
//! getuid()` → treat a failed `initgroups()` as a harmless no-op, the correct behavior on a kernel
//! with no supplementary-group concept, real Linux's own convention for `CONFIG_MULTIUSER=n`) that
//! silently never fired while this returned FreeBSD's `78` instead of musl's real `38`, making `su`
//! die outright instead of degrading gracefully. Was previously deliberately left unfixed pending a
//! wider scope discussion (this constant is referenced far more broadly than the group below) —
//! fixed once a live test demonstrated a concrete functional blocker, not as a preemptive sweep.
//!
//! **The number → handler mapping (`dispatch`'s table) is populated by a dynamically loaded
//! kernel module, not hardcoded here.** `modules/native_abi/` registers `SYS_EXIT`/`SYS_READ`/
//! `SYS_WRITE`/etc. via `oxidebsd_register_syscall` from its own `module_init` — see `CLAUDE.md`'s
//! module-loading section. What stays kernel-resident, deliberately *not* moved into that module,
//! is the actual `sys_exit`/`sys_read`/`sys_write` *behavior*, in `ffi.rs` alongside this file's
//! other syscall-handler implementations. `oxidebsd_sys_exit`/`oxidebsd_sys_read`/
//! `oxidebsd_sys_write` in that same file are the thin FFI adapters the module actually calls
//! through.
//!
//! This file itself (`mod.rs`) is just the real ABI mechanism: `SyscallFrame`, the `SYSCALL`/
//! `SYSRETQ` entry stub and its dispatch table, `redirect_frame`/signal delivery, and errno
//! constants — see `ffi.rs` for every actual syscall handler this kernel implements directly
//! (rather than delegating straight to `process::do_*`).

// `static mut`, not `static`: only ever written/read by this file's own raw asm (`mov [X], rsp`,
// never through a Rust `&`/`&mut`), invisible to the optimizer either way -- same defensive
// treatment as `gdt::CURRENT_RSP0`. Transiently holds the user's `RSP` for the handful of
// instructions between "SYSCALL just landed, RSP is still the user's" and "pushed as the first
// field of this process's own SyscallFrame, on this process's own kernel stack" -- genuinely a
// single global for that brief window (this kernel is single-core and SFMASK keeps interrupts off
// for the whole entry sequence, so at most one syscall can be *entering* at once), but safe past
// that window regardless, since by the time any Rust code able to call scheduler::schedule() runs,
// the saved RSP already lives in the (per-process) SyscallFrame instead of here. A single global
// scratch slot living for the *entire* syscall the way src/linux_syscall.rs's old
// USER_RSP_SCRATCH did would not have been safe here: do_wait4 already blocks and reschedules
// mid-syscall, so a second process could enter its own syscall before the first one returns.
