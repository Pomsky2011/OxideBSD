//! A hardware time source immune to `src/syscall.rs`'s own SFMASK clearing
//! `RFLAGS::INTERRUPT_FLAG` for a syscall's *entire* duration (see that file's own module doc
//! comment). `crate::interrupts::ticks()` is driven entirely by the timer IRQ, which cannot fire
//! while a real ring-3 `SYSCALL` has interrupts masked -- so any tick-based deadline check spun
//! *inside* a syscall handler (`net::oxidebsd_sys_poll`'s timeout, `ipv4::resolve_with_retry`'s
//! ARP wait, `tcp::oxidebsd_sys_connect`'s handshake wait) can never actually elapse when reached
//! via a genuine `SYSCALL` -- `ticks()` is frozen at whatever value it had when the syscall began
//! for the syscall's *entire* remaining duration.
//!
//! **Confirmed live, not theoretical**: converting `tests/poll_smoke.rs` (calls
//! `oxidebsd_sys_poll` as a plain Rust function, interrupts enabled throughout) into
//! `tests/poll_syscall_smoke.rs` (spawns a real ELF, drives the identical scenario through a
//! genuine `SYSCALL`) made the second, empty-socket `poll()` call -- which should time out after
//! 200ms -- hang solid instead, never returning. Exactly the class of blind spot the whole
//! direct-call-to-real-`SYSCALL` test conversion pass exists to catch (see CLAUDE.md's own "Real
//! networking" section on the `hlt()`-in-syscall freeze two of these same three call sites were
//! already fixed for, once, without catching this).
//!
//! `RDTSC` is a plain CPU cycle counter, not interrupt-driven -- it keeps advancing regardless of
//! `RFLAGS::INTERRUPT_FLAG`. Calibrated once at boot, in `crate::init`, while running ordinary
//! interrupt-enabled kernel code (never inside a syscall), against `crate::interrupts::ticks()`'s
//! own known `TIMER_HZ` rate -- the same "plain hardware register, no CPUID gate needed" RDTSC
//! use `src/random.rs` already established.
