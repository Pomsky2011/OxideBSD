//! A minimal xHCI (Extensible Host Controller Interface) driver -- the real USB 2/3 host
//! controller every USB-3-era platform exposes, QEMU's `qemu-xhci` included. See
//! <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/io/universal-serial-bus/extensible-host-controler-interface-usb-xhci.html>
//! for the spec this follows (xHCI 1.1/1.2 register and data-structure layout).
//!
//! **Polling, not IRQ-driven, deliberately** -- see `super`'s own module doc comment for the full
//! rationale (this kernel's first real-hardware boot target has no known-good legacy PCI `INTx`
//! routing story, and this kernel has no IOAPIC/MSI support at all). Interrupter 0's Interrupt
//! Enable bit and `USBCMD.INTE` are deliberately left clear -- the Event Ring mechanism itself
//! (`ERSTBA`/`ERSTSZ`/`ERDP`) works identically either way; only actual CPU interrupt *signaling*
//! is gated by those bits, and this driver never asks for one.
//!
//! **32-byte device contexts only** (`HCCPARAMS1.CSZ == 0`) -- what QEMU's `qemu-xhci` and the
//! overwhelming majority of real platforms use. A controller reporting `CSZ == 1` (64-byte
//! contexts) is logged and treated as unsupported hardware, matching this codebase's existing
//! "known, deliberate gap" style rather than doubling every context struct's size/layout for a
//! case that's very unlikely to matter for this project's actual target hardware.
//!
//! **One command ring, one single-segment event ring, both exactly one page.** A page holds 256
//! 16-byte TRBs -- the last slot is a real Link TRB closing the ring (see `TrbRing`'s own doc
//! comment), so 255 real entries per lap. Nothing this driver does (bringing up one keyboard)
//! comes remotely close to needing more than one segment or a bigger ring.
//!
//! **No page-table mapping needed for this driver's own DMA structures** (rings, contexts, the
//! DCBAA, scratchpad buffers) -- every one of those is a frame this driver allocates itself via
//! the ordinary frame allocator, always real RAM, always within Limine's HHDM guarantee, addressed
//! the same way `memory::BootInfoFrameAllocator`'s own free-list already does: a plain
//! `phys_mem_offset + physical_address` pointer.
//!
//! **The controller's own MMIO BAR is a real, separate case, explicitly mapped by `map_bar_pages`
//! -- found live, not assumed.** An early version of this driver trusted the same HHDM window for
//! the BAR too, reasoning it would sit "within the first few GiB" like `console::framebuffer`'s
//! own doc comment establishes for Limine's linear framebuffer. **That's wrong for a 64-bit BAR**:
//! a real boot under OVMF (UEFI) placed `qemu-xhci`'s BAR0 at physical `0x800000000` (32 GiB) --
//! real firmware deliberately parks large/64-bit BARs in a high MMIO window specifically so they
//! never compete with the low 32-bit PCI hole, and Limine's HHDM only guarantees covering "at
//! least 4 GiB, plus whatever the memory map itself reports" -- a firmware-placed MMIO hole that
//! far up isn't in the memory map at all. The very first capability-register read through the
//! unmapped HHDM address page-faulted immediately, confirming this empirically rather than by
//! spec-reading alone. Fixed with a real, explicit two-phase mapping: `Xhci::init` first maps
//! exactly one page at the BAR's own physical address (enough to safely read the Capability
//! registers, always under 32 bytes), then -- once `HCSPARAMS1`/`DBOFF`/`RTSOFF` are known --
//! computes the real byte extent this driver actually touches (Operational registers through the
//! last root port's `PORTSC`, the Doorbell array through the highest enabled slot, Runtime
//! registers through Interrupter 0's own register block) and maps however many pages that needs.
//! Mapped `NO_CACHE` (true MMIO, unlike the DMA buffers above) via the same `Mapper::map_to`
//! primitive `module::map_region` already uses for module code pages -- this is genuinely the
//! second real use of that primitive in this codebase, not a new pattern.
