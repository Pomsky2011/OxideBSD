//! Real pipes — `src/fd.rs`'s registry gains two new kinds of registered fd (a pipe's read end and
//! write end), backed by an actual, blocking, in-kernel buffer. Added specifically because `sh`
//! (BusyBox's `hush` — see CLAUDE.md's BusyBox section) needs real `cmd1 | cmd2` pipeline support,
//! which `pipe(2)`/`dup2(2)` alone can't provide without something to actually hold the bytes in
//! flight between the two processes.
//!
//! **A pipe read has to genuinely block, not just return `Ok(0)`/`EAGAIN` the way stdin's own
//! non-blocking `sys_read` does.** This kernel is single-core and purely cooperatively scheduled
//! (see `src/scheduler.rs`'s own doc comment) — nothing preempts a running process. If a
//! pipeline's reader (say `cmd2` in `cmd1 | cmd2`) polled an empty pipe and got `Ok(0)`/`EAGAIN`
//! back immediately instead of actually yielding the CPU, it would spin forever on its own kernel
//! stack: `cmd1` (the writer) would never get a chance to run and produce the data `cmd2` is
//! waiting for, since nothing else can interrupt `cmd2`'s busy loop. `pipe_read` below instead
//! blocks for real — `process::BlockReason::WaitingForPipeData`, the exact same
//! block-then-`scheduler::schedule()` pattern `process::do_wait4` already established for blocking
//! on a child process — and `pipe_write`/`pipe_close` wake any process blocked on the pipe they
//! just touched, the same way `process::do_exit` wakes a parent blocked in `wait4`.
//!
//! **Bounded at `PIPE_CAPACITY` (64 KiB, matching real Linux's default pipe size), with a real
//! blocking writer.** Earlier revisions left the buffer an unboundedly-growable `VecDeque<u8>`, so
//! `pipe_write` always succeeded immediately and completely — fine for a shell's own interactive
//! pipeline commands, but a real, live bug for a producer that never yields on its own (`yes |
//! head`: `yes` has no blocking syscall in its write loop, so with no preemption `head` never gets
//! scheduled to read its three lines and close its end, and the buffer grew without limit until
//! the kernel heap allocator itself panicked — see CLAUDE.md's BusyBox section). `write_into` now
//! blocks (`BlockReason::WaitingForPipeSpace`, the write-side mirror of `WaitingForPipeData`) once
//! the buffer is full, writing what fits and looping rather than requiring the whole call to land
//! in one shot — the same partial-write-then-block shape a real blocking pipe write has.
//!
//! **`SYS_SOCKETPAIR`'s `AF_UNIX`/`SOCK_STREAM` support (`do_socketpair` below) is built from this
//! exact same `PipeBuffer`/blocking machinery**, not a separate abstraction — a full-duplex
//! endpoint is just two one-directional buffers cross-wired (this end's writes are the peer's
//! reads and vice versa), so `blocking_read`/`write_into`/`close_direction` are factored out of
//! `pipe_read`/`pipe_write`/`pipe_close` for both to share. Added to unblock BusyBox's `wget`
//! HTTPS path (see CLAUDE.md's "Real networking" known-gaps entry): `spawn_ssl_client`
//! (`networking/wget.c`) forks a TLS-helper child and talks to it over a local socketpair, with no
//! fallback if it doesn't exist. Not a real `AF_UNIX` abstraction — this kernel has no socket
//! address-family concept beyond UDP/TCP/raw-ICMP's own `AF_INET` (`src/net/udp.rs`) — just enough
//! behavior (blocking full-duplex byte stream, real EOF/EPIPE on close) for that one handoff.
