//! Real SysV shared memory (`shmget`/`shmat`/`shmctl`/`shmdt` -- items 17-20 of
//! `docs/MISSING_POSIX_SYSCALLS.md`'s own 28-syscall "pre-reserved ahead of implementation"
//! batch, `SYS_SHMGET = 542` through `SYS_SHMDT = 545`). No live caller anywhere in the current
//! roster (`ipcrm`/`ipcs` were already cut from the BusyBox roster before v0.1 specifically
//! because this didn't exist) -- the last sub-batch, closing the whole 28-syscall batch out.
//!
//! **The only sub-batch that needs real memory-management plumbing, not just a `BTreeMap`
//! namespace** -- unlike `crate::fs::sysv_msg`/`crate::fs::sysv_sem` (both pure in-kernel data
//! structures with an integer-`key_t` front door), a shared memory segment's whole point is real
//! content visible through more than one process's own page tables at once. `shmget` eagerly
//! allocates a fixed `Vec<PhysFrame>` for the segment up front (same "hand out forward, never
//! reclaim" policy `crate::process::mm`'s own `do_mmap`/`BootInfoFrameAllocator` already
//! establish); every `shmat` against that segment -- by any process, related or not -- maps
//! *those exact same frames* into the caller's own page table at a freshly bump-allocated VA
//! (`SHM_REGION_BASE = 0x_4000_0000_0000`, a fresh window distinct from `crate::process::mm`'s
//! own `MMAP_REGION_BASE`), so a write through one process's mapping is genuinely visible through
//! another's -- real shared memory, not a per-process private copy.
//!
//! **Known, accepted simplification: not inherited across `fork`.** This kernel's own `fork` is
//! documented as a full eager address-space copy, not real copy-on-write (see CLAUDE.md's process
//! section) -- `AddressSpace::fork` duplicates the *content* of every user-accessible page into a
//! brand-new physical frame, including whatever's currently mapped at a parent's own shm
//! attachment addresses. That means a forked child ends up with its own private snapshot at the
//! same VA regardless of what this module does, and no amount of attachment-list bookkeeping here
//! would make the child's copy actually alias the segment's real frames. Given that pre-existing
//! architectural fact, `Process::sysv_shm_attach` simply starts empty in a forked child (matching
//! `Process::sysv_sem_undo`'s own "starts fresh across fork" precedent) rather than pretending to
//! support real Linux's "child inherits attached segments" behavior -- the real cross-process
//! sharing case this module *does* support fully is the far more common one: unrelated (or
//! related) processes independently `shmget`ing the same `key` and `shmat`ing it themselves.
//!
//! **A real `nattch`/`IPC_RMID` lifecycle**, same shape `crate::fs::sysv_sem`'s own `SemSet`
//! removal already established for its own `IPC_RMID`: marking a segment for removal detaches its
//! key immediately (a fresh `shmget` on that key can never find it again) but the segment itself,
//! and its real backing frames, survive until the last attached process detaches (`shmdt`, or a
//! real process exit via `detach_all_for_exit`, called from `process::lifecycle::terminate_process`
//! the same way `crate::fs::sysv_sem::apply_undo_for_exit` already is -- see that call site's own
//! comment for why it must run before `PROCESS_TABLE` is locked). Detaching never actually
//! reclaims the underlying frames even once `nattch` reaches zero and the segment is fully
//! removed -- consistent with this whole kernel having no frame-deallocation path anywhere.
//!
//! **`shmat`'s own page-table mapping never unmaps on exit** -- only the `nattch`/removal
//! bookkeeping runs. Harmless: a `Zombie` process's address space is never freed either (no
//! reclamation model exists), and once reaped there's nothing left to unmap from at all.
