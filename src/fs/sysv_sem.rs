//! Real SysV semaphores (`semget`/`semop`/`semctl`/`semtimedop` -- items 21-24 of
//! `docs/MISSING_POSIX_SYSCALLS.md`'s own 28-syscall "pre-reserved ahead of implementation"
//! batch, `SYS_SEMGET = 546` through `SYS_SEMTIMEDOP = 549`). No live caller anywhere in the
//! current roster (confirmed by that doc -- `ipcrm`/`ipcs` were already cut from the BusyBox
//! roster before v0.1 specifically because this didn't exist yet) -- built anyway, in real POSIX/
//! SysV implementation order, closing out the last sub-batch of the whole 28-syscall batch (items
//! 17-20, SysV shared memory, remain unimplemented -- see that doc's own tracking checklist).
//!
//! **Wire formats already fit this ABI's 4 real register args, unlike `msgrcv`/`mq_timedsend`/
//! `mq_timedreceive`** -- confirmed directly against every one of `third_party/musl/src/ipc/
//! sem{get,op,ctl,timedop}.c`'s own call sites (no `SYS_ipc` multiplexer is ever defined on this
//! arch, so each issues its own direct `syscall(SYS_sem*, ...)`): `semget(key, n, fl)` (3 args),
//! `semop(id, buf, n)` (3 args), `semctl(id, num, cmd, ...)` (real Linux's own raw syscall is
//! always exactly `(id, num, IPC_CMD(cmd), arg)`, 4 args), `semtimedop(id, buf, n, ts)` (4 args)
//! -- **zero musl call-site patches needed for this entire sub-batch**, the first SysV IPC
//! sub-batch that's been true for (`msgrcv` needed one; `mq_timedsend`/`mq_timedreceive` needed
//! one each).
//!
//! **`semctl`'s 4th argument is polymorphic based on `cmd`, same as real Linux** -- musl's own
//! `union semun` is passed by value in a single register: for `SETVAL` it's the raw integer value
//! itself (not a pointer), for everything else (`IPC_STAT`/`IPC_SET`/`GETALL`/`SETALL`) it's a
//! real user pointer. `do_semctl` below branches on `cmd` before deciding which interpretation to
//! use, matching real `sys_semctl`'s own behavior.
//!
//! **A real, separate id-keyed namespace, not backed by `oxfs`** -- same "`key_t` -> id via
//! `KEYS`/`SETS`, `IPC_PRIVATE` always fresh, real `IPC_CREAT`/`IPC_EXCL` semantics, bare integer
//! id with no `crate::fs::fd` involvement" shape `crate::fs::sysv_msg` already established for
//! its own `msgget`/`KEYS`/`QUEUES`. `crate::fs::sysv_ipc` factors out the two subsystems' shared
//! `RawIpcPerm`/rwx-permission-check plumbing now that a second SysV IPC subsystem exists.
//!
//! **`semop`/`semtimedop` apply a whole `sembuf` array atomically** -- real SysV semantics: either
//! every operation in the array succeeds at once, or (if any op would block and `IPC_NOWAIT` isn't
//! set) none of them are applied and the caller blocks, then retries the *entire* array from
//! scratch once woken (same "block, `schedule()`, loop and re-check the real condition from
//! scratch" pattern every blocking primitive in this codebase already follows -- see
//! `crate::fs::sysv_msg`'s own doc comment). A negative `sem_op` decrements (blocking if it would
//! go below zero -- a real "wait"/P operation); a positive `sem_op` increments (a real "signal"/V
//! operation, always succeeds immediately); a zero `sem_op` blocks until the semaphore's value is
//! exactly zero. Real POSIX allows an implementation to pick *any* representative op for a wait
//! queue when a multi-op array blocks -- this one always picks the first op in program order that
//! couldn't proceed, both for retry ordering and as the `(semnum, waiting_for_zero)` pair
//! `BlockReason::WaitingForSemOp` carries for `semctl(GETNCNT)`/`semctl(GETZCNT)` to report a
//! real, not fabricated, count against (see that variant's own doc comment, `src/process/mod.rs`).
//!
//! **`semtimedop`'s timeout is real-relative, not absolute** -- unlike `mq_timedsend`/
//! `mq_timedreceive`'s own `at` argument (always wall-clock `CLOCK_REALTIME`), real
//! `semtimedop(2)`'s `timeout` is a plain relative `struct timespec`, the exact same "duration,
//! converted to an absolute tick deadline via `interrupts::ticks() + ...`" shape
//! `do_nanosleep` already establishes (`resolve_relative_deadline` below mirrors that function's
//! own whole-second/sub-second tick rounding exactly) -- deliberately *not*
//! `crate::process::abstime_to_ticks` (`crate::fs::mqueue`'s own helper), which converts an
//! *absolute* timestamp against a chosen clock instead.
//!
//! **Real `SEM_UNDO` support**: every `sembuf` with `SEM_UNDO` set accumulates a signed adjustment
//! in the calling process's own `Process::sysv_sem_undo` list (`record_undo` below) -- applied
//! (added back) automatically on process termination via `apply_undo_for_exit`, called from
//! `process::lifecycle::terminate_process` *before* that function takes `PROCESS_TABLE`'s own lock
//! (see that call site's own comment for why). **Known, accepted simplification**: real Linux also
//! clears/adjusts other processes' outstanding undo entries when a `semctl(SETVAL)`/
//! `semctl(SETALL)`/`semop` on the *same* semaphore changes its value out from under an existing
//! undo adjustment -- this port doesn't track that cross-process bookkeeping (would need a global
//! scan of every process's own undo list on every value-changing call); no live caller to exercise
//! the difference, and `IPC_RMID` (the one case that matters most -- undoing into a since-removed
//! set) is already handled correctly since `apply_undo_for_exit` just finds the `semid` gone in
//! `SETS` and silently skips it, the same "re-check the real condition, a missing id is a no-op"
//! discipline `crate::fs::sysv_msg`'s own `IPC_RMID` already established.
