//! Picks which `Ready` process runs next and performs the actual switch: repointing `CR3`
//! (address space) and `TSS.RSP0` (via `gdt::set_kernel_stack` — the stack the CPU auto-switches
//! to on the next ring-3→ring-0 transition) before handing off to
//! `context_switch::switch_context`.
//!
//! **Real preemption**: a process leaves `Running` either voluntarily (calling `schedule()` itself
//! via `process::do_exit`/`do_wait4`/every other blocking primitive — unchanged) *or* because
//! `interrupts::timer_interrupt_handler` caught it executing ring-3 (user-mode) code and called
//! this exact same `schedule()` directly, once a time quantum elapsed. No raw-asm timer-entry
//! conversion needed (an earlier version of this comment predicted one would be) — `schedule()`
//! itself is just a stack-pointer-swap primitive (`switch_context`) agnostic to *why* the caller
//! is yielding, so calling it from inside the existing `extern "x86-interrupt" fn` works
//! unmodified: the preempted process's own compiler-generated interrupt-return sequence sits
//! dormant on its own kernel stack (below wherever `switch_context`'s `ret` suspended it) until
//! this exact same pid is picked again, at which point unwinding back up through `schedule()` and
//! this file's own call site reaches that dormant `iretq` naturally. **Deliberately scoped to
//! ring-3 only** — kernel/syscall/module code is never preempted (`IA32_SFMASK` already clears
//! `IF` for a `SYSCALL`'s whole duration, and nothing else here runs with `IF` set for long), so no
//! kernel `spin::Mutex`/module-static-data critical section anywhere in this codebase needed
//! auditing for preemption-safety — user-mode code never holds one. See
//! `interrupts::timer_interrupt_handler`'s own doc comment for the ring check/quantum/EOI-ordering
//! details, and `cpu::fpu`'s module doc comment for the one real correctness gap preemption opened
//! up (unsaved SSE/x87 state) and how it's closed (`Process::fpu_state`).
//!
//! **"Nothing runnable" no longer means "spin forever with interrupts masked."** `schedule()`'s
//! own fallback used to be `crate::hlt_loop()` — a deliberate, permanent dead end, safe only
//! because until `sh` (BusyBox's `hush`) needed a real blocking stdin read (`crate::stdin`'s own
//! module doc comment, `process::BlockReason::WaitingForStdin`), *every* blocked process was woken
//! by another *schedulable* process's own syscall (`do_exit` waking a `wait4`er, `pipe_write`
//! waking a pipe reader) — something always eventually ran to do the waking, so an empty ready
//! queue genuinely meant "stuck forever" and burning a core spinning was an acceptable (if wasteful)
//! way to make that visible. A blocked stdin read breaks that assumption: the *only* thing that can
//! ever wake it is a hardware keyboard IRQ, which can't fire at all while `IA32_SFMASK`-cleared
//! `IF` (or a permanently spinning `hlt_loop` that never bothered to `sti` first) keeps interrupts
//! masked. `wait_for_ready` below replaces that fallback with a real idle wait: enable interrupts
//! just long enough to let a hardware interrupt land (the standard `sti; hlt` atomic idiom, so a
//! wakeup racing the check is never lost), then re-disable and re-check. Safe to do here
//! specifically because, by construction, nothing in `schedule()`'s own call path still holds
//! `process::table()`/`READY_QUEUE` at this point (every caller that blocks — `do_wait4`,
//! `pipe_read`, `stdin::read` — drops its locks before ever calling `schedule()`) — the keyboard
//! IRQ handler's own locking of those same structures (to wake a blocked reader) can't deadlock
//! against a lock this code is still holding, because it isn't holding any.
