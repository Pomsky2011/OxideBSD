//! The low-level mechanics of moving execution from one process's kernel stack to another's:
//! `switch_context` (the generic save/restore primitive) plus the two trampolines that give a
//! process that has never run before somewhere to "return" into.
//!
//! `switch_context` only saves/restores System V's callee-saved registers (`rbp`, `rbx`,
//! `r12`-`r15`) plus `RSP` itself, via the ordinary `call`/`ret` mechanism — **not** a full GPR
//! save like `src/syscall.rs`'s `syscall_entry`. Everything else is either caller-saved (already
//! safe on the Rust call stack of whichever function called `scheduler::schedule()`) or, for a
//! process's ring-3 register state, already saved by `syscall_entry`'s own pushes on *that
//! process's own* kernel stack. This is the classic kernel-thread "swtch" pattern (see e.g. xv6),
//! not an interrupt-style save.
//!
//! The restore side of `switch_context` is exactly symmetric with the save side — that symmetry
//! is what lets one primitive handle both "resume a process that previously yielded mid-syscall"
//! (the final `ret` lands back inside `scheduler::schedule()`'s own call site, and execution
//! unwinds normally back up through whatever Rust code was running, e.g. `process::do_wait4`'s
//! loop) and "start a process that has never run at all" (a hand-seeded fake stack frame with the
//! same shape makes the final `ret` land in a trampoline instead). `switch_context` itself has no
//! "first run" special case — only how each process's *initial* stack contents are constructed
//! differs, in `seed_spawn_frame`/`seed_fork_frame` below.
//!
//! Two trampolines, deliberately asymmetric:
//! - `spawn_trampoline_asm` (a process that's never run at all — `pid` 1, or any future non-forked
//!   `spawn`): defensively `and rsp, -16` before `call`ing into real Rust code
//!   (`spawn_trampoline_inner`, `src/process.rs`) — sidesteps hand-deriving the exact stack offset
//!   that would satisfy System V's call-entry alignment convention, which is easy to get subtly
//!   wrong (silent SSE-adjacent misalignment faults) and painful to debug.
//! - `fork_trampoline_asm` (forked children only): jumps straight into
//!   `syscall_return_tail` (`src/syscall.rs`'s `syscall_entry` GPR-pop-and-`iretq` tail) with
//!   **no** realignment at all — `seed_fork_frame` places the copied `SyscallFrame` immediately
//!   below the fake register-save frame, so after `switch_context`'s pops and `ret`, `RSP` already
//!   points exactly at the copied frame's first field, exactly what `syscall_return_tail` expects.
//!   Counter-intuitively the fork path needs *less* defensive code than the spawn path — worth
//!   remembering, since intuition suggests the opposite.
