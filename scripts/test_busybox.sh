# Smoke-tests the BusyBox port in two stages:
#
#   1. Build stage: `cargo build` cross-builds the entire workspace, including every applet in
#      build.rs's BUSYBOX_APPLETS/BUSYBOX_APPLETS_PASS2 roster. build_busybox_applet fails the
#      whole build if a listed applet stops compiling, so a clean build already proves the roster
#      (currently ~300 applets, see docs/BUSYBOX_APPLETS.md) is intact.
#   2. Boot stage: boots the resulting image headlessly under QEMU for a fixed timeout and checks
#      the serial log for a panic/fault-free boot that actually spawns hush (BusyBox sh) as pid 1
#      and reaches the scheduler, with the freshly built roster embedded in oxfs.
#
# What this script deliberately does NOT do: drive the interactive hush prompt. OxideBSD's stdin
# is real PS/2 keyboard input only (src/stdin.rs) -- there is no serial or other channel a
# backgrounded QEMU process exposes that a script can inject keystrokes into. Verifying individual
# applet behavior (`ls`, `cat`, pipes, ...) needs a human at a real `cargo run` window; this script
# only proves the roster builds and the kernel boots cleanly with it embedded.
#
# Usage: scripts/test_busybox.sh [--build-only] [--timeout SECONDS]
