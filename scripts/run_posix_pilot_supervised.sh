# Host-side supervisor for the POSIX conformance pilot (tests/posix_conformance_smoke.rs).
#
# Why this exists: the pilot's own userspace timeout (`t0`, a real `alarm(40)` per test file, see
# modules/oxfs/src/posix_conformance.sh) can only rescue a test that's merely *slow* -- it can't
# rescue a genuine kernel-level wedge, where the stuck process is blocked somewhere no wake hook
# ever re-checks it (an unhandled BlockReason, a stale scheduler entry, a deadlocked futex chain --
# see CLAUDE.md's own history of exactly this bug class). When that happens, `t0`'s own alarm
# either never fires or fires and is never acted on, and the whole rest of the sequential pilot
# script -- and every file after the stuck one -- hangs right along with it. Nothing *inside* the
# guest can rescue that; only something watching from the host, able to kill the QEMU process
# itself, can. This script is that: run the pilot, watch its own progress (a real PASS/FAIL/etc.
# classification line per file), and if nothing new appears for a while, kill QEMU, figure out
# which file was stuck, exclude it, and retry -- automating the "found live, fixed forward"
# discipline this whole file's own `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`/`POSIX_EXTRA_EXCLUDE_FILE` (see build.rs)
# already document doing by hand across many separate sessions.
#
# Real speedup, not just correctness: every file this run has already gotten a real PASS/FAIL/etc.
# classification for (in *this* invocation's own earlier iterations, or a prior resumed one) is fed
# into the same exclude-file mechanism as a genuinely broken file, so the next iteration's own
# kernel image/manifest never re-embeds or re-runs it -- POSIX conformance results are deterministic
# against a fixed kernel binary (nothing here edits kernel source mid-run), so re-verifying an
# already-known outcome every single iteration is pure waste once the corpus gets long. Unlike a
# real exclude, an already-classified file's own outcome still counts toward the final tally (see
# RESULTS_FILE below) -- it's just skipped, not thrown away.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_posix_pilot_supervised.sh [--reset] [--stall-seconds N] [--max-iterations N]
#
#   --reset            start with a clean exclude list and a clean results cache (default:
#                       resume/accumulate across runs)
#   --stall-seconds N  seconds with no new PASS/FAIL/etc. line before treating the run as wedged
#                       (default 120 -- well past t0's own 40s per-file rescue bound, so this only
#                       fires on a real kernel-level hang, not a legitimately slow test)
#   --max-iterations N give up after this many retries (default 30)
#
# On a clean run, prints the final summary and exits 0. Every file this script excludes along the
# way is a REAL FINDING worth investigating and root-causing -- see
# target/posix_extra_excludes.txt afterward, and graduate each one into a real, documented
# POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS entry once understood, the same way every other exclusion in build.rs already
# is. This script's own exclude list is a fast-iteration aid, not a permanent record.
