# Runs the same vendored Open POSIX Test Suite (third_party/posixtestsuite) OxideBSD's own pilot
# (tests/posix_conformance_smoke.rs, modules/oxfs/src/posix_conformance.sh) uses, but compiled and
# run directly on *this host* against its real glibc/Linux -- a genuine, apples-to-apples
# comparison point instead of a guess. Same corpus-discovery rule as build.rs's own
# `discover_posix_test_files` (every real conformance/interfaces/*.c file except *-buildonly.c,
# which expect a driver script's own argv[1] this pilot doesn't provide), same t0-wrapped
# real-alarm(40)-per-file timeout, same PASS/FAIL/UNRESOLVED/UNSUPPORTED/UNTESTED/TIMEOUT/CRASH
# classification posix_conformance.sh uses, so the two tallies are directly comparable.
#
# Must run as root: OxideBSD's own pilot always runs as root (see posix_conformance.sh's own doc
# comment), and plenty of these tests behave differently -- or self-skip via UNTESTED -- depending
# on caller uid, so a non-root host run wouldn't be a fair comparison.
