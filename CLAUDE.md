# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Project

OxideBSD is a 100% Rust-based BSD-like OS, x86_64 only (see `ROADMAP.md` for phase history).
Current state:

- Boots via `bootloader` v0.9 + `bootimage`/QEMU. GDT/TSS/IDT with a dedicated double-fault
  stack, PIC-driven interrupts (timer + PS/2 keyboard), a VGA console mirroring serial, a heap
  allocator over bootloader-provided paging.
- Separate per-process address spaces, ELF64 loading, ring-3 execution, and a native BSD-style
  syscall ABI over `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ` (`src/syscall/mod.rs`) with carry-flag error signaling.
- A dynamic kernel module loader (`src/module.rs`) relocates `#![no_std]` code into the kernel at
  boot and resolves symbol references against a hand-curated kernel API. Syscall handlers are
  registered by modules, not hardcoded: `modules/native_abi/` (core syscalls), `modules/
  posix_compat/` (pipe/dup2/ioctl/setpgid/...), `modules/signal/` (kill/sigaction/...),
  `modules/oxfs/` (the live filesystem).
- `modules/oxfs/` is a real in-memory Unix-shaped inode/block filesystem (real names,
  multi-component paths, per-process cwd, no fixed file-size cap) — replaced `modules/fat32/`
  (8.3 names, one path component per call, fixed file cap), which still builds/self-checks via
  `cargo build` but is no longer loaded at boot.
- A real process table + scheduler (`src/process/`) with `fork`/`execve`/`wait4`/`getpid`, real
  `argv`/`envp` passthrough, blocking pipes, per-process signal delivery, real ring-3 preemption
  (see "Real preemptive scheduling"), and real threading (`clone(2)`/`pthread_create`, see "Real
  threading").
- pid 1 is BusyBox's `hush`, built against a patched musl fork — not the original hand-written
  `userland/stsh/` shell (still buildable, no longer wired up). 256 BusyBox applets run as
  standalone static binaries, `execve`'d individually (not a multi-call `busybox` binary
  dispatching on `argv[0]` — that passthrough exists now, but the roster hasn't been rebuilt to
  use it).
- A real networking stack (`src/drivers/pci.rs`, `src/net/*`, `modules/net/`): PCI + an rtl8139
  driver, Ethernet/ARP/IPv4/ICMP, UDP/TCP/raw-ICMP sockets, `poll(2)`, and real hostname
  resolution over musl's own DNS stub resolver (no DNS protocol code of its own) — see "Real
  networking" below.
- A real, on-target C compiler (`third_party/tinycc`, vendored TinyCC) — `tcc` runs as an ordinary
  seeded `/bin` binary and can genuinely compile+link a real C file against a real, seeded
  `/usr/include`/`/usr/lib` musl tree, producing a real runnable ELF — see "TinyCC" below. Real
  `futex(2)` and milestone 1 of real dynamic linking (`PT_INTERP`, see "Dynamic linking" below)
  also exist — but GCC/Clang remain unstarted: both need real multi-process subprocess pipelines
  (`cc1`/`as`/`ld` as separate `fork`+`execve`d binaries) neither of the above by itself provides.

Known, deliberate gaps: no pointer validation in `sys_read`/`sys_write`, no module unload/reload,
no *kernel-mode* preemption (real ring-3/user-mode preemption exists), no copy-on-write fork, no
frame deallocation for module-loaded code/SysV-shm-or-`MAP_SHARED`-owned frames (real reclaim
exists for the common case — a discarded process's own private address-space frames — see "POSIX
conformance pilot" below), `sys_read` on stdin is non-blocking (busy-polled by userland), no
general block-device-agnostic VFS/mount-table layer (a real ATA disk driver + oxfs mount/format
persistence + a scoped bind/tmpfs mount table exist now — see "Real disk persistence"/"Mount
table" — but only for oxfs's own fixed backing store), no IPv6, no real routing table (one
default-gateway rule only). See "BusyBox gap analysis" below for what's needed to go further.
Architecture decisions for remaining subsystems haven't been made — discuss with the user before
large structural commitments.

## Toolchain

- Nightly Rust, pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`. Load-bearing unstable features: `-Z build-std`
  (no prebuilt std for the custom target), `-Z json-target-spec`, `-Z panic-abort-tests`.
- Requires `bootimage` (`cargo install bootimage`) and `qemu-system-x86_64` on `PATH`.
- `.cargo/config.toml` sets the default target to `x86_64-oxidebsd.json` and
  `runner = "bootimage runner"`.

## Commands

- `cargo build` — kernel ELF only
- `cargo bootimage` — bootable disk image
- `cargo run` — boot in QEMU, serial to stdio
- `cargo test` / `cargo test --test basic_boot` — each target boots its own QEMU instance (slow;
  no fast check path exists)
- `cargo clippy` / `cargo fmt`

These commands at the repo root only target the `oxidebsd` package. `userland/*` and `modules/*`
are separate workspace members that the root `build.rs` cross-builds as a side effect of building
`oxidebsd`. To build one directly: `--manifest-path <dir>/<name>/Cargo.toml --target-dir
target/userland` (or `target/modules`) — a separate target dir avoids a nested-cargo lock deadlock
against the outer build. `modules/fat32/` additionally needs `FAT32_IMAGE_PATH` set when built
this way (normally supplied by the root `build.rs`).

## Test architecture

No libtest — `no_std`, tests boot in QEMU and self-report via `src/qemu.rs` (writes to the
`isa-debug-exit` port; `test-success-exit-code` in `Cargo.toml` must stay in sync with
`QemuExitCode::Success`) and `src/console/serial.rs` (hand-rolled 16550 UART, read via `-serial
stdio`).

- `src/lib.rs` defines `no_std` test scaffolding (`custom_test_frameworks`, `#[test_case]`) and
  boots itself under `#[cfg(test)]`.
- `tests/*.rs` integration tests use `harness = false` — each defines its own `fn main()` via
  `entry_point!` and calls `exit_qemu()` directly.
- `tests/fork_wait.rs` + `userland/fork-exec-smoke/`: since `scheduler::start`/`process::do_exit`
  never return to a test's own `main`, it registers a syscall number (`9999`) directly via
  `oxidebsd::syscall::oxidebsd_register_syscall` (kept `pub` for this) whose handler calls
  `exit_qemu`.
- **Any test claiming to verify syscall-reachable code should spawn a real ELF and go through an
  actual `SYSCALL` instruction**, not call kernel handlers as plain Rust functions from a test's
  own `main()` — interrupts stay enabled and `ticks()` keeps advancing in the latter, hiding real
  bugs (see "Real networking" gotcha 2 below). Established pattern (`tests/*_syscall_smoke.rs` +
  `userland/*-syscall-smoke/`) for anything syscall-shaped added from here on.
- Anything needing live interactive keyboard input (real Ctrl+C→SIGINT, `su`/`login` prompts,
  `sulogin`/`getty` tty takeover, persistence surviving a real QEMU restart, any `reboot`/halt/
  poweroff success path) can't be scripted and is manual-QEMU-only — hand it to the user rather
  than trying to drive it via a backgrounded `cargo run`.

## Custom target spec (`x86_64-oxidebsd.json`)

- `target-pointer-width`/`target-c-int-width` must be numbers, not strings.
- Float returns need both `"features": "...,+soft-float"` and `"rustc-abi": "softfloat"`, or
  `core`/`compiler_builtins` fail to build.
- `panic-strategy: "abort"` is the only supported strategy — hence `-Z panic-abort-tests` in
  `.cargo/config.toml` (otherwise Cargo builds an unwind-based test harness and produces a second,
  ABI-incompatible `core`).
- SSE/MMX disabled, `disable-redzone: true` (interrupt handlers can't safely use either).

## Memory management (`src/memory/mod.rs`, `src/memory/allocator.rs`)

- `memory::init` walks `CR3` and adds `BootInfo::physical_memory_offset` to get a virtual pointer
  to the level-4 table. Call at most once — hands out a `&'static mut`.
- `memory::BootInfoFrameAllocator` bump-allocates from `BootInfo::memory_map`'s `Usable` regions.
  Holds plain `(region_index, frame_number)` cursor state, not a rebuilt-each-call iterator (the
  old approach was O(n²)). **A boxed-iterator "fix" is wrong, not just suboptimal**: this
  allocator is constructed *before* `allocator::init_heap` (which needs it to map the heap's own
  pages), so any heap allocation inside its own constructor panics with no heap yet to satisfy it.
  Gained a real `FrameDeallocator` impl later — see "POSIX conformance pilot" below.
- `allocator::init_heap` and `module::map_region` map freshly allocated pages with `.ignore()`,
  not `.flush()` — a never-before-mapped page has no stale TLB entry, and `invlpg` is individually
  trapped under QEMU's software TCG.
- The heap lives at a fixed VA (`allocator::HEAP_START`); size scales with detected RAM
  (`memory::usable_ram_bytes()`), clamped floor/ceiling (currently `1024` MiB ceiling, QEMU RAM
  `8192` MiB). Same RAM-scaling pattern for `process::kernel_stack_size()`/`user_stack_pages()`.
  NOT scaled: `modules/fat32`'s embedded image size, `module::MODULE_VA_BASE`/
  `MODULE_REGION_CEILING` (a VA-range limit from the relocation model, not RAM).
- Global allocator is `linked_list_allocator`'s `Heap` wrapped in a local `Locked<T>`
  (`spin::Mutex`), not the crate's own `LockedHeap` — avoids a second spinlock crate in the graph.

## User-mode execution (`src/memory/address_space.rs`, `src/process/elf.rs`, `src/process/usermode.rs`)

`process::spawn` builds the first process this way at boot; `process::do_execve` builds every
later one the same way, mid-syscall.

- Userland crates (`userland/*`) are separate workspace members; `build.rs`'s
  `build_userland_crate` cross-builds each into `target/userland/` and exposes `<NAME>_ELF_PATH`
  via `cargo:rustc-env` for `include_bytes!`. Each crate's `linker.ld` forces a distinct load base
  clear of the kernel image, heap, phys-mem-offset window, and `bootloader` v0.9's own
  identity-mapped low-memory region. **This floor moves as the kernel image grows** — surfaces as
  `Elf(MappingFailed)`/`PageAlreadyMapped` at `execve`/spawn time, not build time. Currently
  `0x4000000` (64 MiB). **Before adding a new binary or trusting this number**, re-derive it:
  `readelf -l target/x86_64-oxidebsd/debug/oxidebsd | grep -A1 LOAD`, take highest
  `VirtAddr + MemSiz`, round up with real headroom. `userland/musl-smoke/` isn't a Rust crate —
  built with `musl-gcc`, load base via `-Wl,-Ttext-segment=`.
- `AddressSpace::new` shallow-copies all 512 L4 entries from the currently active table — safe
  only when the active table's user-space content is empty (true only for boot spawn).
  `AddressSpace::fork`/`new_excluding_user` (live process) instead recursively walk the table
  using `USER_ACCESSIBLE` as the sole kernel-vs-user signal at any level.
- **`gdt.rs`'s ring-0 stacks must be `static mut`, not `static`.** A plain `static`, never written
  via a Rust `&mut`, gets interned into `.rodata` by the optimizer — causes a double/triple fault
  the instant an exception uses it. Any future stack added the same way needs the same treatment.
- **Every IDT gate a software interrupt (`int n`, `int3`, ...) can trigger from ring 3 needs
  `DPL = Ring3` explicitly** — gates default to `Ring0`. Wrong DPL manifests as a `#GP` on the IDT
  entry itself.
- **`elf::load` tracks already-mapped pages in a `BTreeMap<Page, PhysFrame>` for one call** —
  `PT_LOAD` segments align to `p_align`, not to each other, so small binaries routinely share a
  page across segments. Flags aren't unioned across segments sharing a page — **found live** via
  `userland/sa-siginfo-syscall-smoke` (first userland crate with real writable globals): a small
  RW segment sharing a page with an RX segment kept only the RX flags, so the first static write
  page-faulted. Worked around at the linker-script level for that crate (`. = ALIGN(0x1000);`
  before writable sections), not fixed in `elf.rs` — a real flag-union fix would help every future
  small binary with writable globals but wasn't done.
- Known simplification: no `NO_EXECUTE` on any ELF segment (would also need `EFER.NXE`).

## Syscall ABI (`src/syscall/`)

OxideBSD's own native, BSD-flavored ABI over `SYSCALL`/`SYSRETQ` — not Linux-compatible. Syscall
number in `RAX`, up to 4 args in `RDI`/`RSI`/`RDX`/`R10` (not `RCX`/`R11`, clobbered by `SYSCALL`
itself). Success/failure via the **carry flag** (`CF=0` success, value in `RAX`; `CF=1` failure,
positive errno in `RAX` — traditional BSD/x86 Unix convention). Pre-musl-port syscalls
(`SYS_EXIT=1`, `SYS_FORK=2`, `SYS_READ=3`, `SYS_WRITE=4`, `SYS_OPEN=5`, `SYS_CLOSE=6`,
`SYS_WAIT4=7`, `SYS_LSEEK=8`, `SYS_GETPID=20`, `SYS_EXECVE=59`) match real FreeBSD numbers as an
authenticity nod. Everything since is OxideBSD's own invention, picked for what porting
musl/BusyBox actually needed: `SYS_MMAP=100`...`SYS_UTIMENSAT=167`/`SYS_SETSID=112`/
`SYS_GETSID=177`/`SYS_SETGROUPS=178`/`SYS_MOUNT_BIND=174`/`SYS_MOUNT_TMPFS=175`/`SYS_UMOUNT2=176`
(the `100-178` batch: mmap/munmap/brk/fs_base/writev/pipe/dup2/getppid/getcwd/unlink/rmdir/
rename/kill/sigaction/sigprocmask/sigreturn/setpgid/getpgid/ioctl/dup/fstat/stat/lstat/getdents/
uname/clock_gettime/nanosleep/socket family/poll/socketpair/set_tid_address/fcntl/shutdown/readv/
readlink/symlink/setitimer/getitimer/uid-gid family/chmod/chown), then `SYS_FSYNC=471` through
`SYS_FSTATFS=477`, `SYS_PRLIMIT64=478` through `SYS_REBOOT=486`, `SYS_UMASK=487`, `SYS_LINK=488`,
`SYS_MKNOD=489`, `SYS_CHROOT=490`, `SYS_GETRUSAGE=491`, `SYS_MPROTECT=492`, the pre-reserved
`526`-`553` POSIX/SysV batch (see that section), `SYS_FAULT_PUMP=554`, `SYS_CLONE=555`,
`SYS_EXIT_GROUP=556`, `SYS_FUTEX_REQUEUE=557`; plus real
Linux numbers reused directly where confirmed dead in this musl fork (`fchmod=91`,
`sched_getaffinity=204`, `futex=202`). **Check `src/syscall/` and module sources for the current
highest number before assigning a new one.**

**Before picking a new syscall number**: grep every still-inert real-Linux value in
`third_party/musl/arch/x86_64/bits/syscall.h.in` for a live musl caller before reusing it — bit
twice already: `SYS_KILL`'s invented number collided with real Linux's inert `setgroups` (which
*did* have a live musl caller via `initgroups()`), silently misrouting `setgroups()` into
`kill(2)`; and a later batch continuing `100-178` collided with real, still-referenced numbers
(`__NR_gettid`, live in `src/thread/synccall.c`). Since this musl fork is frozen at tag `v1.2.6`,
`471`+ (past the highest real-Linux number `bits/syscall.h.in` ever inspects) is *permanently*
collision-free — continue new invented numbers from there, or from this ABI's own highest already-
assigned number, whichever is higher.

errno **is meant to** use FreeBSD's values where Linux/BSD diverge, but whatever this file returns
via the carry-flag ABI becomes musl's raw `errno` directly (see `syscall_arch.h`'s `jnc`/`neg`
conversion) — it must match musl's own compiled-in `bits/errno.h`, not real FreeBSD.
`EBADF`/`EINVAL`/`ECHILD`/`ENOEXEC`/`EPIPE`/`ESRCH`/`ENOTTY` happen to be identical between
Linux/generic and FreeBSD. **Known, currently-wrong** (real FreeBSD values that don't match musl,
deliberately deferred — discuss scope before a sweeping renumbering): `src/net/udp.rs`'s
`ENOTSOCK=38` (musl: `88`), `EDESTADDRREQ=39` (musl: `89`), `EADDRINUSE=48` (musl: `98`),
`EHOSTUNREACH=65` (musl: `113`); `src/net/tcp.rs`'s
`EISCONN`/`ENOTCONN`/`ECONNREFUSED`/`ETIMEDOUT`/`EOPNOTSUPP`/`EADDRINUSE`/`EHOSTUNREACH`. **Already
fixed** (confirmed load-bearing by a live test): `src/syscall/mod.rs`'s
`EPROTONOSUPPORT=93`/`EAGAIN=11`/`ENOTSOCK=88`/`ENOSYS=38` (was FreeBSD's `78`; blocked `su`'s real
`ENOSYS`-fallback path), `tcp.rs`'s own `EAGAIN=11` (was `35`).

The number→handler mapping is a runtime registry (`SYSCALL_TABLE`, `Mutex<BTreeMap>`) populated by
`oxidebsd_register_syscall` from each module's `module_init` — not a hardcoded `match`. An
unregistered number logs `[boot] unrecognized syscall number N` and returns `ENOSYS`, the main
tool for discovering what a ported program's startup still needs.

- **`SYSRETQ`'s selector scheme forces GDT order.** `SYSRETQ` derives `SS`/`CS` from
  `IA32_STAR[63:48]` as `+8`/`+16` — user data must sit immediately before user code. `src/cpu/
  gdt.rs` order: kernel code, kernel data, unused placeholder, user data, user code, TSS. Don't
  reorder without redoing the `STAR` arithmetic; `Star::write` panics loudly if the GDT regresses.
- **No automatic stack switch on `SYSCALL` entry.** Control arrives at `syscall_entry` still on
  the user's own stack. `gdt::CURRENT_RSP0` (`static mut`, kept in sync by
  `gdt::set_kernel_stack` on every context switch) always names the current process's own kernel
  stack — required since two processes can be mid-syscall at once. No per-CPU `swapgs` —
  single-core only.
- `SyscallFrame`: the stub's pushed GPRs plus `user_rsp`. `rcx`/`r11` double as saved `RIP`/
  `RFLAGS`; `syscall_dispatch` flips bit 0 of `r11` to signal `CF`.
- `dispatch()` is a small, pure, directly unit-tested function separate from
  `syscall_dispatch`'s raw-pointer/frame handling.
- A registered handler's own wire format (`SyscallHandler`) is a plain `i64` (negative = `-errno`)
  — distinct from the public carry-flag ABI, just the module↔kernel boundary's shape.
- `sys_write`/`sys_read` don't validate `[ptr, ptr+len)` before dereferencing — a bad pointer
  page-faults (handled safely: log + reboot for ring-0, real signal delivery for ring-3 — see
  "Real ring-3 fault-to-signal delivery" below), not a soundness hole.
- `sys_read` on stdin is non-blocking by design (returns `Ok(0)` on empty). Any other fd delegates
  to `crate::fd`'s per-process `(Pid, fd)` registry.
- `sys_write`'s `fd == 2` (stderr) is an alias for `fd == 1` — no real second sink exists.

## musl port (`third_party/musl`, `userland/musl-smoke/`, `src/process/user_stack.rs`, `src/cpu/fpu.rs`)

musl is patched (not the kernel made Linux-compatible) to speak this native ABI directly.
`third_party/musl` is a submodule of a personal fork (`ifduyue/musl`), patches on its own
`oxidebsd` branch based on tag `v1.2.6`. Pin/update by committing on that branch, pushing, then
`git add third_party/musl` here. Patch surface is deliberately small, entirely under
`arch/x86_64/`: `syscall_arch.h` (carry-flag→negative-errno conversion after every `syscall`),
`bits/syscall.h.in` (only the `__NR_*` values musl's static-binary startup path actually reaches
are remapped), `__set_thread_area.s` (TLS base via `SYS_SET_FS_BASE`, a bare base-address write).

Key gotchas, each a real bug already hit and fixed — the same *class* of bug can recur for any
future syscall port, so re-check these when adding one:
- musl's stdio write path goes through `writev`, never plain `write` — `SYS_WRITEV` is
  load-bearing (its absence once silently redirected all `printf` output into `getpid()` via a
  numbering collision — no crash, just zero output).
- **Remapping a `__NR_*` macro isn't enough if a 64-bit-suffixed sibling exists.** `src/internal/
  syscall.h` unconditionally prefers `SYS_getdents64` over `SYS_getdents` whenever both are
  defined — found live for `getdents`, both now remapped and kept in sync. Any future syscall with
  a same-shaped 64-bit sibling (`__NR_stat64`, `__NR_fstatat64`, ...) needs the same audit.
- SSE was never enabled at the hardware level; `src/cpu/fpu.rs::init()` enables it once at boot.
  Real per-process `FXSAVE`/`FXRSTOR` across every context switch exists (`Process::fpu_state`) —
  became load-bearing once ring-3 preemption landed (see "Real preemptive scheduling").
- `src/process/user_stack.rs` builds a real System V argc/argv/envp/auxv stack. `AT_PHDR` derived
  from the `PT_LOAD` segment with smallest `p_offset` (linker scripts don't map the ELF header
  into any segment). `AT_RANDOM` is a fixed placeholder.
- **`open`/`execve` argument-convention mismatches are fixed on the musl side**, not by remapping
  alone: length-prefixed `RawArgvEntry{ptr, len}` arrays instead of NUL-terminated `char**`, real
  4th syscall arg (`R10`) for `envp_ptr`. Same length-prefix pattern for
  `unlink`/`rmdir`/`rename`/`readlink`/`symlink`/`chdir`/`mkdir`. **Any future libc call ported
  here needs the same audit** — matching the syscall *number* isn't sufficient if the argument
  shape differs.
- **A hand-written asm stub can bypass the `__NR_*` remap table entirely.** `vfork.s` hardcoded
  the real Linux syscall number directly; fixed by hardcoding OxideBSD's own `SYS_FORK` instead (a
  real `fork()`, not true vfork semantics — POSIX-legal). **Any syscall with its own hand-written
  arch-specific asm stub needs this same direct-patch treatment, not just a header remap** — bit
  again later for `clone.s`/`__unmapself.s` (see "Real threading").
- `utimensat` drops the always-`AT_FDCWD` `fd` arg, passes `(path_ptr, path_len, times_ptr,
  flags)`. Kernel side is existence-check only (oxfs has no per-inode timestamps at the time this
  landed — real mtime/ctime tracking came later, see "SIGCHLD + sched fixes").
- `SYS_MMAP=100` is `(addr_hint, len, prot)` originally, later gained real `flags` (see mmap fixes
  below) — packed into `prot`'s unused high bits. `SYS_BRK=102` grows/shrinks `Process.brk`, no
  reclaim on shrink.

## BusyBox port (`third_party/busybox`, `modules/posix_compat/`)

256 applets run today (24 original + 232 from a second-pass roster), each its own standalone
single-applet static binary. Vendored as a submodule (fork of `mirror/busybox`, tag `1_36_1`,
`oxidebsd` branch — same pin/update procedure as musl). `build.rs`'s `build_busybox_applet` runs
`allnoconfig` → flip one applet's Kconfig symbol → `oldconfig` → build, asserting
`NUM_APPLETS == 1`; `sh` additionally forces on `CONFIG_HUSH_INTERACTIVE`/`HUSH_JOB`/
`FEATURE_EDITING` and hush's control-flow symbols directly (`allnoconfig` writes an explicit
"not set" before `oldconfig` ever sees hush's own `default y`). Applets are embedded into oxfs's
inode table by `modules/oxfs`'s `module_init` (data-driven from `build.rs`'s applet lists; each
new applet needs one manual `seed_file` call). Roster grew 24 → 290 (287 from an exhaustive
per-applet build probe — **"builds" is a much weaker bar than "works"**), then curated down to 232
(256 total) before v0.1 by dropping 58 applets structurally incapable of working under this
kernel's architecture (see `docs/BUSYBOX_APPLETS.md`'s "Removed before v0.1"; a few later
unblocked — `chroot`/`mknod`/`link` — were fixed forward instead). `docs/BUSYBOX_APPLETS.md` is the
full roster with per-applet needs (`NEEDS_NETWORK`/`NEEDS_PROC`/`NEEDS_CLOCK`/`NEEDS_UID`/`WORKS`).
`modules/oxfs/src/test_busybox.sh` (seeded at `/test_busybox.sh`) is ~95 real applet/control-flow
checks with a `PASS`/`FAIL` tally — the tool that found several bugs below.

- `build_busybox_applet` is staleness-checked against `third_party/busybox`/`build.rs`/
  `musl_sysroot`'s `lib/libc.a` mtimes, builds in parallel. **Two real staleness bugs found**: (1)
  `libc.a`'s mtime wasn't originally compared, so a musl fix left applets linked against stale
  libc. (2) BusyBox's incremental build never tracks musl's *installed sysroot headers* as a
  dependency — a musl header fix left most object files unrecompiled despite fresh binary mtimes.
  **Only a full `rm -rf` of the stale `O=` out-of-tree build dir reliably fixes this** — trust
  neither BusyBox's incremental tracking nor mtime alone. Expensive (~38 min full rebuild), only
  triggers when something genuinely changed.
- `hush` (pid 1) uses real `execvp()`/`$PATH` (`PATH=/bin` in envp). `modules/oxfs` seeds every
  applet under its bare name in `/bin`.
- New kernel-resident pieces `sh` required: real 4th syscall arg (`R10`, envp), real blocking
  `pipe(2)`/`dup2(2)` (`src/fs/pipe.rs`, `PIPE_CAPACITY=64` KiB, blocks via `BlockReason::
  WaitingForPipeData`/`WaitingForPipeSpace`), and a **per-process** `(Pid, fd)` fd table
  (`src/fs/fd.rs`) — a flat table broke real pipelines when a parent closed its own copy of a pipe
  fd out from under still-using children.
- **Fixed: a producer whose `write()` never blocks used to OOM the kernel heap.** `yes | head -n
  3` reliably panicked — `src/fs/pipe.rs`'s buffer used to be an unbounded `VecDeque<u8>`, and
  with no preemption `head` never got scheduled to stop `yes`. Fixed by bounding the buffer
  (`write_into` now blocks the producer once full, `EPIPE` on read-end close) rather than adding
  preemption.
- **`IA32_FS_BASE` (TLS) is a single global MSR never saved/restored per-process by
  `context_switch::switch_context`** — a resuming musl-linked parent would silently inherit a dead
  child's leftover TLS base and fault its own stack-protector check. Fixed via `Process::fs_base`,
  restored on every switch by `scheduler::activate_and_prepare`.
- `getcwd`/`getppid`/`chdir`/`mkdir` needed the same argument-convention fixes as `open` — only
  surfaced once `hush` was driven interactively.
- musl's stdio calls `write(fd, buf, 0)`/`read(fd, buf, 0)` with a null/garbage `buf`
  (POSIX-legal at length 0) — crashed every fd callback's unconditional `slice::from_raw_parts`;
  fixed centrally in `src/fs/fd.rs`'s `read`/`write` funnel functions.
- New syscalls always go in a dedicated module (`modules/posix_compat/`, `modules/signal/`, ...),
  not `modules/native_abi/` — keeps the core ABI module small.

## Interactive shell (`src/console/stdin.rs`, `userland/stsh/`)

`stsh` ("stupidshell") is the original hand-written interactive userland program — still
buildable, no longer pid 1 (superseded by `hush`). Its design remains the reference for stdin:

- Keyboard IRQ (`src/cpu/interrupts.rs`) decodes scancodes into a fixed 256-byte ring buffer
  (`src/console/stdin.rs`) — non-ASCII dropped, no allocation in the interrupt handler. `sys_read`
  drains it. Auto-echo only when `TERMIOS.ECHO` is set.
- The `spin::Mutex` around the ring buffer can't deadlock between IRQ and syscall context
  specifically because `SFMASK` clears `IF` for a `SYSCALL`'s entire duration on this single core
  — breaks if SMP is ever added.
- `sys_read` is non-blocking; `stsh` busy-polls a byte at a time.
- `src/console/vga.rs`'s `Writer` is a true 2D-addressable console with a minimal ANSI/VT100 CSI
  escape parser so full-screen applets (`vi`, `clear`, `reset`) render correctly.
- Real `SYS_IOCTL=124` (`src/console/stdin.rs`'s `RawTermios`, a single **global**, not
  per-session, `TERMIOS`) implements `TCGETS`/`TCSETS*`/`TIOCGWINSZ` (fixed `24x80`)/`TIOCSWINSZ`;
  else `ENOTTY`. Only succeeds against the real console — load-bearing for `isatty()`.
- No pty/foreground-process-group layer at this file's level — `tcsetpgrp`/`bg`/`fg` are driven
  entirely by the real session/controlling-tty model at the process level (see "Session,
  controlling-tty..." and "Real job control" below); this file's only involvement is the
  Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Z keyboard intercepts in `interrupts::keyboard_interrupt_handler`.

## Process abstraction, scheduler, and fork/exec/wait (`src/process/`)

Dynamically allocated process table, scheduler (cooperative round-robin + real ring-3 preemption,
see "Real preemptive scheduling"), kernel-thread-style context switch between per-process kernel
stacks. No copy-on-write fork (full eager copy), no SMP. **`Process` is no longer strictly one
schedulable entity per real process** — real `clone(2)`/`pthread_create` threads sharing one
address space also exist (`Process::tgid`, `ThreadGroupShared`, a per-thread-group `Arc<Mutex<>>`
bundle covering `cwd`/`root_inode`/`umask`/`uid`/`gid`/`brk`/`mmap_file_regions`) — see "Real
threading" for the full design.

- **Process table is `Mutex<BTreeMap<Pid, Box<Process>>>`, `Box` is load-bearing** — a
  `BTreeMap`'s internal nodes can move on insert/remove, but a `Box`'s heap allocation never does;
  holding the table lock across a context switch would deadlock. Every function touching both the
  table and `scheduler::schedule()` drops the lock first.
- `context_switch::switch_context` only saves System V callee-saved registers + `RSP`. Two
  first-run trampolines: `spawn_trampoline_asm` and `fork_trampoline_asm` (jumps into
  `syscall_entry`'s GPR-pop/`sysretq` tail).
- `fork` resumes the child via a copy of the parent's live `SyscallFrame` with `rax=0` and CF
  explicitly cleared.
- `do_execve` builds everything (new `AddressSpace`, `elf::load`, user stack) *before* mutating
  the live frame/`CR3`/stored `AddressSpace` — a failure at any point must leave the caller
  untouched, matching real `execve(2)`.
- **Real `#!interpreter [arg]` shebang support**: `do_execve` peeks the target's first two bytes;
  if `#!`, parses interpreter + one optional trailing argument, re-targets the load at the
  interpreter, looping up to `MAX_SHEBANG_DEPTH=4` (past which `ELOOP`).
- Per-process state across `fork` (copied)/`execve` (mostly preserved): `cwd` preserved; `brk`
  copied, not reset; `fs_base` copied, reset to 0; `pgid` inherited, untouched; signal state
  (`sigactions` reset to `SIG_DFL` for caught handlers only; `pending`/`blocked` untouched);
  `uid`/`gid` copied, preserved; `sid` inherited, untouched; `rlimits`/`nice`/`sched_policy`/
  `sched_priority`/`umask` copied, preserved (stored, not enforced); `root_inode` copied,
  untouched. Itimer state resets on `fork`, preserved by `execve` (the one exception).
- Kernel stack size floor is `128` KiB — found empirically. No guard page — overflow corrupts
  silently.
- **`do_wait4`'s reported status is real `wait(2)`-encoded — normal exit shifts into bits 8-15**
  (`WEXITSTATUS`). Signal-based termination passes a pre-encoded `128 + sig` directly, must
  **not** be shifted.
- **`kill(pid, 0)`** does a real existence-only check (self or cross-process; a zombie still
  counts until reaped), bypassing the pending-signal bitmask.
- `tests/fork_wait.rs` + `userland/fork-exec-smoke/` covers fork/wait4/exit.
  `modules/oxfs/src/test_busybox.sh` is real, broader, hand-run coverage.

## Dynamic kernel modules (`src/module.rs`, `modules/*`)

Loads independently-compiled, relocatable (`ET_REL`) `#![no_std]` objects into the kernel's
currently-active address space at boot: relocates them, resolves referenced symbols against a
hand-curated kernel API table, calls `module_init`. Distinct from `elf.rs` (loads a
non-relocatable `ET_EXEC` binary with zero relocations) — this is the largest subsystem.

- `build.rs`'s `build_module_crate` runs `cargo rustc --release --lib -- --emit=obj` then a
  mandatory relocatable partial relink (`rust-lld -flavor gnu -r`) against the exact
  `core`/`alloc`/`compiler_builtins` `.rlib`s.
- `--gc-sections -u module_init` on that relink is **required, not optional** — coarse
  archive-member selection during `-r` linking otherwise pulls in entire bundled `core`/`alloc`
  object files (once ballooned a module to 3+ MB/2900 sections, exhausting the boot-time heap).
- `RUSTFLAGS="-C relocation-model=static"` keeps relocations to absolute 32-bit forms — every
  module must map inside the low 2 GiB (`MODULE_VA_BASE=0x10000000`,
  `MODULE_REGION_CEILING=0x80000000`). A few GOT-indirected references survive anyway — handled
  via a minimal, eagerly-populated per-relocation-site GOT.
- **No `core::fmt::Write`/`write!` in module code** — that trait object's vtable emits a GOTPCREL
  reference, the single largest bloat source before `--gc-sections`. Hand-rolled byte formatting
  instead.
- **Modules can't use `alloc`/`Vec`/`BTreeMap`** — avoids depending on `#[global_allocator]`'s
  unstable-ABI internals from relocated code. State lives in fixed-size `static mut` arrays.
- **A `static mut` gotcha distinct from `gdt.rs`'s**: a private `static mut` buffer written but
  never observably read back through an externally-reachable function can have the write deleted
  as an unobservable dead store. Module state needs a syscall-reachable read to survive
  optimization.
- Modules are mapped kernel-only (no `USER_ACCESSIBLE`), every page `WRITABLE` (relocation must
  patch code bytes; no W^X anywhere in this kernel yet).
- A module panic is fatal to that call (no unwinding). `module::CURRENT_MODULE_FATAL` (`static
  mut`) gates a per-module `fatal_on_panic: bool` — `false` for every module except `oxfs`
  (`hlt_loop()`); `oxfs` reboots the whole system (a real disk attached makes a torn
  superblock/inode-table write worse to resume past than an in-memory panic).
- `serial_println!` can't take implicit `{name}`-style captures (its `concat!`-based expansion
  blocks it) — use explicit positional args; `serial_print!` has no such restriction.
- Known limits: no module unload/reload, no versioning, no inter-module direct calls (only
  module→kernel via each module's own resolved symbol table — why `src/fs/fd.rs`'s registry
  exists at all).

## Filesystem: oxfs (live) and FAT32 (superseded)

**`modules/oxfs/`** is the live filesystem — a real Unix-shaped inode/block filesystem. In-memory
by default, with real optional persistence to an attached ATA disk (see "Real disk persistence").
Fixed-size `static mut` pools: `NUM_BLOCKS=16384` × `BLOCK_SIZE=4096` (64 MiB), `MAX_INODES=2048`,
each inode with 12 direct blocks + one single-indirect block (max **single-file** size ~4 MiB,
independent of `NUM_BLOCKS` — a known, accepted cap smaller than FAT32's, revisit via indirect
blocks/block-size bump if it starts mattering). `NO_BLOCK = u32::MAX` is the "unallocated"
sentinel. Directories are ordinary inodes holding fixed 32-byte records (real names,
`NAME_MAX=26`) that grow additional blocks on demand. `unlink`/`rmdir` only clear a record's
`used` byte (no dealloc). Root is fixed inode `0`, self-referencing `.`/`..`.

- Real multi-component path resolution (`resolve_path`/`resolve_parent`, handling `.`/`..`).
- Real **per-process** cwd: `Process::cwd` (opaque inode number), falls back to `BOOT_CWD` for pid
  `0` (module_init's own self-check).
- Open files stream directly from the block chain on read; writes accumulate in a fixed buffer
  (`MAX_WRITE_BUFFER=131072`) and commit to a real inode at `close`.
- Syscalls: `SYS_OPEN=5`, `SYS_CLOSE=6`, `SYS_CHDIR=12`, `SYS_MKDIR=136`, `SYS_GETCWD=108`,
  `SYS_UNLINK=109`, `SYS_RMDIR=110`, `SYS_RENAME=111`, `SYS_FSTAT=126`/`SYS_STAT=127`/
  `SYS_LSTAT=128` (byte-exact 144-byte musl `struct stat`), `SYS_GETDENTS=129`. `st_uid`/`st_gid`/
  `mode`/timestamps are real (see "Permission model") — `oxfs_lstat` doesn't follow a final
  symlink, `oxfs_stat` does.
- Seed files (BusyBox applet ELFs, the musl/tcc runtime tree, fixtures) are embedded via
  `include_bytes!` in `module_init`, no build-time disk image needed.

**`modules/fat32/`** (superseded, kept for its own build/self-check, not loaded at boot): 8.3
names only, one path component per call, a directory that can never grow past its first cluster,
one kernel-wide cwd, whole-file-buffered reads, no `unlink`/`rmdir`/`rename`.

**`src/fs/fd.rs`** (shared by both, now `tgid`-keyed — see "Real threading"): a per-process
`(Pid, fd)` scoped registry — the only coordination channel between independently-loaded modules.
Bump-allocated fd numbers, never reused.

## Real disk persistence (`src/drivers/ata.rs`, `modules/oxfs`)

Scoped deliberately: real disk I/O and oxfs mount/format persistence, not a general VFS/mount-table
layer.

- **`src/drivers/ata.rs`**: hand-rolled ATA PIO driver, kernel-resident — classic legacy IDE,
  LBA28, **polling only, no IRQ**, fixed legacy ports. Every BSY/DRQ wait is bounded by a real
  `crate::tsc`-based deadline (never `hlt()`, never unbounded) — reachable from inside a real
  syscall handler with interrupts masked.
- **One fixed target: secondary channel, master** (`bootimage` attaches the boot image itself as
  primary master). `run-args` points at `target/oxfs_disk.img` (created only if missing);
  `test-args` at `target/oxfs_test_disk.img` (always freshly zeroed).
- **On-disk layout**: physical block `0` is the superblock (magic `b"OXFS"` + version + layout);
  packed inode table follows; then the block-used bitmap; real data after that. **Never a raw
  transmute/memcpy of `Inode`** — `pack_inode`/`unpack_inode` serialize by hand.
- **Mount-or-format, decided once in `module_init`**: no disk → in-memory only. Disk attached,
  superblock magic **and** stored layout match this build → **mount** (eager-load only used data
  blocks). Magic mismatch, or layout mismatch → **format** (reset the in-memory pool to all-free
  first — a stale bitmap/inode-table load must never leak into a fresh format), reseed, then
  `flush_all_to_disk`.
- **Write-through persistence, centralized at three functions**: `write_block`, `write_inode`,
  `set_block_used` are the *only* functions that ever touch `BLOCKS`/`INODES`/`BLOCK_USED`.
- **`PERSISTENCE_READY`** (`static mut` gate) stays `false` for the entire format/mount duration,
  set `true` right after, before any real syscall becomes reachable.
- **Known, accepted limitation: mount-time load is bitmap-filtered, not true lazy fault-in** — the
  pinned `x86_64` crate has no `rep insw`/`outsw` wrapper, so every 512-byte sector transfer is
  256 individually-trapped port reads under QEMU's TCG.
- **No raw block device is exposed to userland** — the disk is purely internal to oxfs's own
  persistence.
- Verified via `tests/ata_smoke.rs`, `tests/oxfs_persistence_syscall_smoke.rs`. **Not covered**:
  persistence surviving a real QEMU restart — manual only.
- **Operational gotcha**: mounting never re-syncs seeded content against the kernel's current
  embedded bytes — only a fresh *format* does. A fix to seeded content needs
  `target/oxfs_disk.img` deleted (destructive to anything created at the hush prompt — ask the
  user first) and reformatted on the next `cargo run`.

## Mount table (`modules/oxfs/`)

A real, but deliberately scoped, mount table — `mount --bind`/`mount -t tmpfs` only, not a general
pluggable-filesystem-type VFS.

- **A second, purely in-memory inode/block pool for tmpfs**: `BLOCKS`/`BLOCK_USED`/`INODES`
  extended with a tail region (`TMPFS_NUM_BLOCKS=1024`/`TMPFS_MAX_INODES=128`, 4 MiB). Block
  allocation picks the real vs. tmpfs pool via `inode_ensure_block_at`'s `inode_num >= MAX_INODES`
  test; new-inode allocation uses a shared `alloc_inode_in(parent)` chokepoint (found live: three
  call sites used to call plain `alloc_inode()` unconditionally, wrongly persisting tmpfs-created
  files to the real pool). Never reclaimed on unmount.
- **The mount table itself** (`MountEntry`/`MOUNTS`, `MAX_MOUNTS=8`): each entry records the real
  inode a mountpoint shadowed and where lookups redirect instead. `resolve_path_impl` checks
  `active_mount_for` right after each component's `dir_lookup`. Scanned LIFO.
  - Tmpfs mount root's `..` points at the mountpoint's real parent.
  - Bind mount reuses the source directory's own real inode directly — known limitation: `cd ..`
    from inside it follows the source's real parent, not the mountpoint's.
  - `st_dev` is `1` (real fs) or `2` (tmpfs pool) — a bind mount deliberately keeps `st_dev == 1`.
  - **The redirect only fires where `resolve_path_impl`'s per-component loop actually runs** —
    doesn't cover a handler using `resolve_parent` + its own bare `dir_lookup` (correct for
    `mkdir`/`symlink`'s EEXIST check, wrong for `open`'s "existing path" branch — found live,
    fixed for `oxfs_open` specifically).
- **`SYS_MOUNT_BIND=174`/`SYS_MOUNT_TMPFS=175`/`SYS_UMOUNT2=176`** — landed on real Linux's
  long-obsolete `create_module`/`init_module`/`delete_module` slots rather than continuing past
  `SYS_UTIMENSAT=167` (168-170 are real, live `swapoff`/`reboot`/`sethostname` numbers).
  `third_party/musl/src/linux/mount.c` dispatches to one of these two based on `fstype`/`flags`.
- **`/proc/mounts`**: a local formatter produces mtab-shaped lines directly from mount-table state.
- Verified via `tests/mount_syscall_smoke.rs`. **Not covered**: a real block-device-agnostic mount
  table (`pivot_root`/`switch_root`), anything needing a real partition table.

## Permission model (`src/process/`, `modules/oxfs/`, `modules/posix_compat/`)

Real uid/gid, real per-inode `mode`/`uid`/`gid`, real `chmod`/`chown`, real `open()` permission
enforcement. Only one uid existed (root, `0`) until "Session, controlling-tty..." below adds a
real second user.

- `Process` gains `uid`/`gid` — no separate saved/effective pair. `0` at spawn; copied by fork;
  preserved by execve.
- Syscalls: `SYS_GETUID=158`/`SYS_GETEUID=159`/`SYS_GETGID=160`/`SYS_GETEGID=161`/
  `SYS_SETUID=162`/`SYS_SETGID=163`/`SYS_GETGROUPS=164` (`posix_compat`) and `SYS_CHMOD=165`/
  `SYS_CHOWN=166` (`oxfs`).
- **`do_setuid`/`do_setgid`**: real POSIX rule — root may become any uid/gid; anyone else may only
  "become" the uid/gid they already are (no-op success); any other target is `EPERM`.
- **`do_getgroups`** reports a single-element list (caller's own `gid`) — no supplementary-group
  concept.
- **`Inode` gains real `mode`/`uid`/`gid`** (default `FIXED_PERM=0o755`/`0`/`0`). A freshly
  **created** file is owned by its real creator (`OpenFile::Write` gained `owner_uid`).
- **`check_access(inode, uid, gid, want_write)`**: `uid==0` bypasses rwx bits entirely; otherwise
  picks owner/group/other by comparing against the inode's own `uid`/`gid`. Wired into
  `oxfs_open`; `do_execve`'s ELF-loading read goes through this same path (approximate execute
  check).
- **Real write-to-an-existing-file support**: `OpenFile::Write` gained `existing_inode: Option<u32>`
  — `None` is create-new (fresh inode + dir entry at close); `Some(inode)` overwrites in place.
  `O_APPEND` preloads the write buffer with existing content. This filesystem's write primitive
  always replaces a file's complete contents in one shot. Opening a directory with
  `O_WRONLY`/`O_RDWR` is a real `EISDIR`.
- **`oxfs_chmod`**: owner or root only; follows a final symlink. **`oxfs_chown`**: root-only
  unconditionally; supports real POSIX `(uid_t)-1`/`(gid_t)-1` "leave unchanged"; follows a final
  symlink (`lchown` unimplemented).
- **`oxidebsd_current_uid`/`_gid`** (exported to modules) — how oxfs learns the caller's identity.
  `pid == 0` reports root.
- **`/etc/passwd`/`/etc/group`** seeded with a single `root:x:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh` entry (grown
  later — see next section). musl's own `getpwuid`/`getpwnam`/`getgrgid`/`getgrnam` parse these
  directly.
- Verified via `tests/uid_syscall_smoke.rs`. **Not covered**: mutating `/etc/passwd`/`/etc/group`
  (applet-level gap), `lchown`/`fchown` (fchmod later done, see below),
  setuid/setgid/sticky bits.

## Session, controlling-tty, and login authentication (`src/process/`, `src/console/stdin.rs`, `src/cpu/interrupts.rs`, `modules/posix_compat/`, `modules/oxfs/`)

Closes `su`/`login`/`sulogin`/`getty`.

- **A real second user**: `/etc/passwd` gains `user:x:1000:1000:User:/home/user:/bin/sh` (real
  `/home/user`, owned `1000:1000`, mode `0700`). **A real `/etc/shadow`** (mode `0600`, root-owned)
  holds real SHA-512 (`$6$`) `crypt(3)` hashes (password equals username) — musl's stock
  `crypt` code needed zero changes.
- **A real session model**: `Process` gains `sid: Pid`. Two new **single, not per-session**
  globals in `src/console/stdin.rs`: `CONTROLLING_SESSION: Option<Pid>`, `FOREGROUND_PGID:
  Option<Pid>` — this kernel has exactly one real console.
  - **`SYS_SETSID=112`**: `EPERM` if the caller is already a process-group leader; else becomes
    leader of a fresh session+pgroup.
  - **`SYS_GETSID=177`** (invented — real Linux's `124` means `SYS_IOCTL` here).
  - **`SYS_IOCTL` gains `TIOCSCTTY`/`TIOCNOTTY`/`TIOCGPGRP`/`TIOCSPGRP`**, gated to the real
    console fd. `TIOCGPGRP` falls back to the session id when nothing's called `TIOCSPGRP` yet.
  - **Real Ctrl+C → `SIGINT` to the foreground process group**: keyboard IRQ intercepts ASCII ETX
    (`0x03`) before the stdin ring buffer, only when `ISIG` is set **and** `FOREGROUND_PGID` is
    claimed — see "Real job control" below for how pid 1 gets a controlling tty automatically.
  - Verified via `tests/session_syscall_smoke.rs`, run as a forked child of pid 1. Real Ctrl+C
    delivery is manual-QEMU-only.

**Two real bugs found live-testing `su`, both worth remembering for any future syscall number**:
1. **A real syscall-number collision**: this ABI's invented `SYS_KILL` equaled real Linux's inert
   `setgroups` number, which *does* have a live musl caller (`initgroups()` → `setgroups()`,
   called by `su`). Fixed by giving `setgroups` its own number (`SYS_SETGROUPS=178`, root-only
   genuine no-op). Confirms the syscall-ABI rule above.
2. **`ENOSYS` mismatch, concretely breaking real functionality**: BusyBox's `change_identity()`
   treats a failing `initgroups()` as harmless when it's real `ENOSYS` and the target uid already
   equals the caller's — never fired because this kernel's old `ENOSYS` (FreeBSD's `78`) didn't
   match musl's compiled-in `38`. Fixed by correcting the constant.

## Signal handling module (`modules/signal/`, `src/process/signals.rs`, `src/syscall/mod.rs`)

Real `kill(2)`/`sigaction(2)`/`sigprocmask(2)` + delivery, plus
`sigtimedwait(2)`/`sigwaitinfo(2)`/`sigwait(3)`/`sigqueue(2)`. `SYS_KILL=116`/`SYS_SIGACTION=117`/
`SYS_SIGPROCMASK=118`/`SYS_SIGRETURN=119` match real Linux/BSD wire formats (pure number remap).
`SYS_SIGTIMEDWAIT=495`/`SYS_SIGQUEUE=496` are real, unclaimed
`__NR_rt_sigtimedwait`/`__NR_rt_sigqueueinfo` values. Real signal numbers (`SIGHUP=1`...
`SIGSYS=31`), extended later to real-time signals `SIGRTMIN..=SIGRTMAX` (`35..=64`, see "RT signal
queuing" below).

- `Process::sigactions: [SigAction; 65]` (real `SIG_DFL=0`/`SIG_IGN=1`) plus `pending_signals`/
  `blocked_signals` bitmasks, `pending_siginfo: [QueuedSigInfo; 65]` (real per-signal sender
  `pid`/`uid`/`si_code`/`sigqueue` value), and a real `signal_stack: Vec<SignalStackFrame>` (see
  "Real signal-stack chaining" below).
- Delivery happens once, at the tail of `syscall_dispatch` (and now also from `sigreturn` itself —
  see chaining below). `sigreturn` bypasses the normal `Ok`/`Err` carry-flag rewrite entirely.
- `do_kill` cross-process: immediate for the common case (no handler → terminate right there, even
  against a blocked target); deferred until next-scheduled only if the target has a custom
  handler. **Real permission checking** (`has_signal_permission`): sender must be root or share
  the target's uid, else `EPERM` — single-target paths only, not `signal_foreground_group`'s
  broadcast. **Real process-group targeting** (`target_pid == 0`/`< 0`) — see "Real job control".
- **Real `SA_SIGINFO` handler invocation**: `RawSiginfo`/`RawUcontext`/`RawMcontext` built on the
  handler's own stack frame with real GP registers and `uc_sigmask`. **`RawSiginfo`'s
  `si_code`/`si_errno` field order was a real bug, fixed** — see "siginfo field-order bug" below;
  three userland smoke crates hand-duplicate this struct and needed the same fix.
- **`sigtimedwait`/`sigwaitinfo`/`sigwait`**: real POSIX semantics directly *consume* a pending
  signal matching `wait_set`, **bypassing handler invocation** even if one's installed
  (`BlockReason::WaitingForSpecificSignal`). A signal used this way must be blocked via
  `sigprocmask` first, and for cross-process delivery needs a real handler installed too (the
  no-handler immediate-terminate path doesn't consult `blocked_signals`).
- **`sigqueue`**: real `(pid, sig, siginfo_ptr)`, single-target only.

## Real job control: Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Z, colored tty, `kill(-pgrp)` (`src/process/`, `src/cpu/interrupts.rs`, `build.rs`)

**Root cause, no BusyBox patch needed**: `hush.c` has always shipped a complete job-control
startup sequence that activates itself *if* it discovers a controlling tty — it never did, since
pid 1's stdin/stdout were wired directly to the console, never through a real `open()`. **Fix**:
`process::spawn` calls `console::stdin::set_controlling_session(pid)` directly right after
inserting pid 1 — mirrors what a real kernel does. That's what makes `FOREGROUND_PGID` get
claimed (via `hush`'s own `TIOCSPGRP`), unlocking the pre-existing Ctrl+C interception.

- **Colors**: `TERM=linux` + a colored `PS1` added to pid 1's `envp`. Real `ls --color` needed its
  own Kconfig flip in `build.rs`. This BusyBox fork's `grep` has no color feature at all.
- **Real `kill(-pgrp, sig)` process-group broadcast** (`do_kill`'s `target_pid <= 0` branch) —
  `hush`'s own `fg`/`bg` and job-cleanup paths depend on it. Reuses `signal_foreground_group`'s
  exact per-process action resolution.
- **Real `SIGSTOP`/`SIGTSTP`/`SIGCONT`** (genuine Ctrl+Z suspend/`bg`/`fg` resume):
  `ProcState::Stopped(u64)` (payload = stopping signal). `DefaultDisposition::Stop` split from the
  old blanket `Ignore` bucket. `SIGCONT` gets a pre-dispatch step at every cross-process-capable
  call site: an actually-`Stopped` target always resumes regardless of its own disposition, then
  still falls through for a caught handler. `do_wait4` real `WUNTRACED`/`WCONTINUED`/`WNOHANG` —
  `WNOHANG` is load-bearing since `hush.c`'s own `checkjobs(NULL, 0)` polling would otherwise
  block the whole shell (no real `SIGCHLD` existed yet at this point — added later, see "SIGCHLD +
  sched fixes"). New wire status shape: `WIFSTOPPED` writes `0x7f | (stopsig << 8)`;
  `WIFCONTINUED` writes `0xffff`.
  - **A real regression found live**: `process::timers::do_nanosleep` was the one blocking call
    that didn't loop and re-check its wake condition after `scheduler::schedule()` returns. Real
    `SIGCONT` unconditionally wakes a `Stopped` process regardless of what it was blocked on, so
    `bg`-ing a Ctrl+Z-stopped `sleep 100` woke it almost immediately instead of at its real ~100s
    deadline. Fixed by looping and re-checking `ticks() < deadline` — **any future mechanism that
    can force an arbitrary process back to `Ready` cross-process needs the same audit** of every
    non-looping `scheduler::schedule()` call site.
  - Not covered: real `SIGTTIN`/`SIGTTOU`-driven job control (still `Ignore`).

## Real-time clock (`modules/clock/`, `src/cpu/pit.rs`, `src/cpu/rtc.rs`)

`SYS_CLOCK_GETTIME=138` — real `clock_gettime(2)` wire format; `time()`/`gettimeofday()` are
wrappers around it.

- **`src/cpu/pit.rs`** reprograms PIT channel 0 to a fixed `TIMER_HZ=100` at boot.
- **`src/cpu/rtc.rs`** reads the CMOS RTC. `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` converts `ticks()` against
  `TIMER_HZ`. **Real sub-second `CLOCK_REALTIME`** (`unix_epoch_now_precise`) — calibrates a fixed
  `ticks() -> real seconds` offset against the RTC exactly once (lazily), then derives every later
  reading from `ticks()` — needed for `nanosleep/1-1,2-1.c` (see "Three more pilot fixes" below),
  since a fresh whole-second RTC read almost never landed inside a short sleep.
- **`SYS_NANOSLEEP=139`** — converts to an absolute wake-up tick deadline, blocks, woken by the
  timer IRQ scanning the process table. **Real signal-interrupts-sleep**: checks
  `pending_signals & !blocked_signals` before each re-block, returns `EINTR` with real remaining
  time — needed a new `wake_if_sleeping` hook wired into every `Action::SetPending` call site (see
  "Three more pilot fixes").

## Real networking (`src/drivers/pci.rs`, `src/net/*`, `modules/net/`)

Real, phased stack: PCI enumeration, IRQ-driven rtl8139 driver, Ethernet/ARP/IPv4/ICMP, UDP/TCP
sockets, raw ICMP sockets, `poll(2)`, and real hostname resolution via musl's own stub resolver.

- **`src/net/rtl8139.rs`**: brought up unconditionally at boot, absence logged not fatal.
- **`ipv4::next_hop`** is the *only* routing rule (anything outside `GUEST_IP`'s `/24` → gateway).
- **`src/net/udp.rs`/`tcp.rs`**: real sockets behind `SYS_SOCKET=140`/`SYS_BIND=141`/
  `SYS_SENDTO=142`/`SYS_RECVFROM=143`/`SYS_SETSOCKOPT=144` (UDP) and `SYS_CONNECT=145`/
  `SYS_LISTEN=146`/`SYS_ACCEPT=147` (TCP; once `Established`, plain read/write). TCP is
  stop-and-wait (one segment in flight, fixed 536-byte MSS, no window/congestion control).
- **`src/net/icmp.rs`** raw sockets: not port-addressed, every inbound ICMP fans out to every open
  raw socket.
- **`SYS_POLL=148`**: reports `POLLIN` only; an fd not owned by udp/tcp/icmp is always ready.
- **Real DNS resolution**: `/etc/resolv.conf` seeded with SLIRP's DNS relay.
  `recvmsg`/`sendmsg` delegate to `recvfrom`/`sendto` for the single-iovec shape musl's resolver
  actually uses.

**Architectural gotchas, apply to any future syscall-reachable busy-wait**:
1. **QEMU needs `-accel kvm -accel tcg`** (two repeated flags) in both `run-args`/`test-args`, or
   every boot runs pure-software TCG (can stretch boot past a minute under host load).
2. **`hlt()` inside a syscall handler can freeze the CPU permanently.** `SFMASK` clears `IF` for a
   syscall's entire duration — no timer tick can fire to advance `ticks()` either. Any
   syscall-reachable retry loop must use `core::hint::spin_loop()`, never `hlt()`, gated on
   **`src/cpu/tsc.rs`** (`RDTSC`-based, immune to `IF`) — **never `crate::interrupts::ticks()`**,
   frozen for a syscall's whole duration. Current spin-loop-with-tsc-deadline sites:
   `ipv4::resolve_with_retry`, `tcp::oxidebsd_sys_connect`, `net::oxidebsd_sys_poll`. **Invisible
   to any test calling kernel handlers as plain Rust functions instead of through a real
   `SYSCALL`.**
3. **`tcp_read` blocks on spin-loop, deliberately not the `pipe`-style `BlockReason` pattern** —
   incoming-packet processing is pull-based; yielding here would mean nothing services the
   connection once the only interested process stops running. Real EOF (`0`) only once the peer
   has actually FIN'd.

Real-`SYSCALL` smoke tests exist for every scenario (`tests/{udp,poll,ping,socketpair,
tcp}_syscall_smoke.rs`), using test-only syscalls (`SYS_TEST_EXIT=9999`,
`SYS_TEST_INJECT_UDP_FRAME=9998`, `SYS_TEST_TCP_STEP=9997`).

**Other real pieces landed for this stack**: `alarm()`/`setitimer()` (`SYS_SETITIMER=156`/
`SYS_GETITIMER=157`, `modules/clock/`, only `ITIMER_REAL`, expiry only sets `pending_signals`, not
inherited by fork); `socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)` (`SYS_SOCKETPAIR=149`, built on
`src/fs/pipe.rs`); getting `wget` HTTPS working needed five further fixes in sequence:
`SYS_SET_TID_ADDRESS=150`, `SYS_FCNTL=151` (`F_GETFL`/`F_SETFL(O_NONBLOCK)`/`F_SETFD`/`F_DUPFD*`),
`SYS_SHUTDOWN=152` (real half-close for a pipe-backed socketpair only), a synthetic
`/dev/{u}random,null,zero` path backed by **`src/random.rs`** (a real
SHA-256-seeded ChaCha20 generator gathering `RDTSC`/PIT/RTC/`RDRAND`/`RDSEED` when available, plus
a persistent `ENTROPY_POOL` folding real IRQ-timing jitter from keyboard/rtl8139 handlers —
`RDRAND`/`RDSEED` are distrusted whenever `running_under_hypervisor()` is true, since a hypervisor
can trap and fake either instruction undetectably; both crates need soft-float-equivalent backend
flags for this SSE-disabled target), and `SYS_READV=153`; plus a real `tcp_read` EOF-vs-empty fix.
No real routing table, no IPv6 anywhere. BusyBox's vendored TLS client doesn't validate certificate
chains (a limitation of that vendored code, not fixable kernel-side).

## Filesystem/process misc syscalls: fsync, ftruncate, fallocate, flock, statfs, prlimit64, nice, chrt, reboot (`modules/oxfs`, `modules/posix_compat`, `src/reboot.rs`)

`link`/`mknod`/SysV IPC/`chroot`/namespaces/`inotify`/ext2 `ioctl`s/`xattr` were a distinct,
deliberately-out-of-scope gap at the time this landed (`link`/`mknod`/`chroot` since done — see
next section); namespaces don't fit this single-address-space kernel at all.

- **All sixteen numbers land at `471`-`486`** — see the syscall-ABI collision rule above.
  `oxfs`'s `SYS_FSYNC=471`...`SYS_FSTATFS=477`, `posix_compat`'s `SYS_PRLIMIT64=478`...
  `SYS_REBOOT=486`.
- **`SYS_FSYNC`/`SYS_SYNC`** are real, not stubs — a shared `commit_write_buffer` (from
  `oxfs_close`) is callable for one fd or swept across every open write fd.
- **`SYS_FTRUNCATE`/`SYS_FALLOCATE`** resize directly at the block level, not via a whole-content
  buffer (the 128 KiB kernel-stack floor can't hold a ~4 MiB file). Growing zero-fills only the
  new region.
- **`SYS_FLOCK`** is a real per-inode `LOCK_SH`/`LOCK_EX`/`LOCK_UN` advisory table (16 entries),
  released on close. A conflicting request fails `EAGAIN` immediately even without `LOCK_NB` — no
  scheduler-yield primitive is reachable from a module syscall handler.
- **`SYS_STATFS`/`SYS_FSTATFS`** report a real musl-layout `struct statfs` (120 bytes) from live
  block/inode-usage counts.
- **`SYS_PRLIMIT64`** backs `getrlimit`/`setrlimit`. `Process::rlimits: [(u64,u64); 16]` — stored,
  never enforced.
- **`SYS_SETPRIORITY`/`SYS_GETPRIORITY`** (`nice`) — `Process::nice: i32`, no real scheduling
  effect. **`SYS_SCHED_SETSCHEDULER`/`_GETSCHEDULER`/`_GETPARAM`/`_GET_PRIORITY_MAX`/`_MIN`**
  (`chrt`) — stored/echoed honestly, no real effect (later gains real `sched_setparam`, see
  "SIGCHLD + sched fixes").
- **`SYS_REBOOT`** (+ `src/reboot.rs`) matches real Linux's `RB_AUTOBOOT`/`RB_HALT_SYSTEM`/
  `RB_POWER_OFF` magic values. No permission check. Every success path halts/resets/powers off the
  VM — manual-QEMU-only.
- **`SYS_UMASK=487`**. `Process::umask: u32` (default `0o022`) — real per-process state, stored
  but not actually consulted anywhere oxfs creates a new inode.
- Verified via `tests/needs_syscall_smoke.rs` (except `reboot`/`umask`, manual-only).

## Real hard links, device nodes, per-process chroot, and getrusage/wait4 rusage (`modules/oxfs`, `modules/posix_compat`, `src/process/`)

- **`SYS_LINK=488`/`SYS_MKNOD=489`/`SYS_CHROOT=490`** (`oxfs`), **`SYS_GETRUSAGE=491`**
  (`posix_compat`).
- **Real hard links**: `Inode` gains `nlink: u16`. `oxfs_link` follows symlinks, rejects
  directories (`EPERM`) and cross-pool links (`EXDEV`). `oxfs_unlink` decrements `nlink` (still
  never actually freed).
- **Real device nodes**: `InodeKind::Device`, `Inode::rdev`/`device_char`. `mknod` creates a real,
  listable inode, but `oxfs_open`'s `Device` dispatch only services major:minor pairs matching the
  same four `/dev/{random,urandom,null,zero}` devices — any other is `ENXIO`. Also supports
  `S_IFREG`; `S_IFIFO`/`S_IFSOCK` are `EINVAL`. Root-only.
- **Real per-process `chroot`**: `Process::root_inode: u64` mirrors `cwd`'s design (`0` = never
  chrooted). `resolve_path_impl` gains a `root_inode` parameter for containment (`..` stays put at
  root). Root-only, doesn't also `chdir`.
- **`SYS_GETRUSAGE` + real `wait4` rusage**: real, correctly-shaped, all-zero `struct rusage` (no
  per-process CPU-time/memory accounting exists).
- **A real regression found by the full test suite**: making `wait4`'s 4th arg (`R10`) meaningful
  broke several hand-written userland `syscall()` helpers that never zeroed `R10`. **Any future
  syscall upgrading 3→4 real arguments needs an audit of every userland crate's own hand-rolled
  `syscall()` helper.**
- Verified via `tests/needs_syscall2_smoke.rs`.

## Two syscalls found live by the expanded `test_busybox.sh` post-v0.1

Both real, unremapped Linux `__NR_*` values used directly (confirmed unclaimed elsewhere in this
ABI's registry).

- **`fchmod`** (`oxfs_fchmod`, real `__NR_fchmod=91`): found via `uudecode`'s real
  `fchmod(fd, mode)` on its still-open output fd — silently `ENOSYS`'d before. Uses
  `resolve_write_fd_inode` + the same owner-or-root check as `oxfs_chmod`.
- **`sched_getaffinity`** (`do_sched_getaffinity`, real `__NR_sched_getaffinity=204`): found via
  `nproc` (which silently fell back to `count=1` on failure, so the gap only showed as a logged
  unrecognized-syscall line). Single-core, mask always bit 0 — writes `min(cpusetsize, 8)` real
  bytes, real raw-syscall return convention.

## TinyCC: a real, on-target C compiler (`third_party/tinycc`, `modules/oxfs`, `build.rs`)

`tcc` is a single monolithic static binary with real upstream musl support (`--config-musl`).
Vendored as a submodule (`Pomsky2011/tinycc-oxidebsd`, `oxidebsd` branch, tag `release_0_9_27`).
`build_tinycc()` cross-builds via `musl-gcc` against the existing musl sysroot; needs explicit
`--crtprefix=/usr/lib --libpaths=/usr/lib --sysincludepaths=/usr/include`. `libtcc1.a` is built via
tcc's `-usegcc=yes` escape hatch (safe — pure freestanding numeric helpers, no syscalls).

**Two real, deep bugs found getting `tcc -static -o hello.elf hello.c && ./hello.elf` working**:
1. This dev machine's host `gcc` defaults to PIE, and musl's own `configure` auto-detected that,
   letting PIE-style GOT-indirect codegen leak into `crt1.o`. Every other consumer links via real
   GNU ld's silent GOTPCRELX relaxation, hiding this — TinyCC's linker doesn't implement that
   relaxation, so the first `tcc`-produced binary faulted on an instruction fetch through a
   never-written GOT slot. Fixed by forcing `-fno-pie -fno-PIC` for the whole musl build (a full
   `make distclean` + fresh sysroot rebuild, transitively relinking every BusyBox applet).
2. **TinyCC generates real PLT/GOT indirection for external calls even under `-static`.**
   PLT/lazy-binding has no meaning with no dynamic loader present. Fixed by patching
   `third_party/tinycc/tccelf.c`'s `build_got_entries` to extend its hidden-visibility no-PLT
   carve-out to also fire whenever `s1->static_link` is true.
3. **A separate crash**: bare `tcc hello.c` (no `-static`) produced a dynamically-linked `a.out`
   that faulted at `VirtAddr(0x0)` (no `PT_INTERP` support existed at the time — since added, see
   "Dynamic linking", but TinyCC's own output was never revisited). Fixed at the root:
   `libtcc.c`'s `tcc_new()` now defaults `s->static_link = 1` unconditionally.

- **`SYS_LSEEK=8`** — tcc's object-file loader needs a real file size upfront (`fseek`/`ftell`)
  before parsing ELF/`ar` headers. Only `{FileRead,DirListing,ProcRead,ProcDir}` variants have a
  real seek position; `Write` and synthetic `/dev/*` report `ESPIPE`.
- **A real, generated on-target runtime tree**: `/usr/include` (musl headers), `/usr/lib`
  (crt/libc.a/musl stub archives), `/usr/lib/tcc` (`libtcc1.a` + tcc's 5 bundled headers).
  Generated by `build.rs`'s `write_tcc_runtime_manifest` into a single `include!`'d generated
  Rust file — literal absolute `include_bytes!` paths, not the per-file `env!()` pattern every
  other embedded ELF uses.
- `modules/oxfs` gained real directory-tree seeding infra: `ensure_dir` (idempotent) and
  `seed_tree` (splits `/`-separated paths, walks/creates intermediates).
- Verified via `tests/tcc_syscall_smoke.rs` — real `fork`+`execve` `tcc -static -o /hello.elf
  /hello.c`, `wait4`, then `fork`+`execve` the produced ELF itself (proving the *output* is a real
  runnable binary), plus the same round trip via bare `tcc -o` (no `-static`, exercising bug 3's
  fix). **Not covered**: `-run` (in-memory JIT execution), self-hosting.

**A real, three-layered disk-persistence bug found on an already-formatted disk** when
`MAX_INODES` changed the on-disk inode-table size: (1) a stale bitmap could leak into a
fallback-to-format path — fixed by always resetting the in-memory pool to all-free before any
format run that might follow a partial mount attempt; (2) `build.rs`'s own hand-duplicated
metadata-block-count constant went stale — fixed by computing it from the real constants; (3)
`mount_from_disk`'s superblock check was magic-only, not layout-aware — fixed by checking stored
`SUPERBLOCK_VERSION`/`NUM_BLOCKS`/`MAX_INODES` too; (4) the persistent dev disk was only ever
created if missing, never grown if undersized — fixed to grow in place (zeros appended, real bytes
untouched).

## Dynamic linking: milestone 1, real `PT_INTERP` (`src/process/elf.rs`, `src/process/lifecycle.rs`, `build.rs`, `modules/oxfs`)

A real, working `fork`+`execve` of a genuinely dynamically-linked ELF, resolved/relocated by
musl's own real `ld.so` running as the interpreter — not this kernel doing the linking itself.

- **A second, fully separate `-fPIC`/shared musl build** produces a real `libc.so`
  (`/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1` is a symlink to it, matching musl's own real convention).
- **`elf.rs` accepts `ET_DYN` alongside `ET_EXEC`** — solely for a `PT_INTERP` interpreter image.
  `elf::load` gained a real, kernel-chosen additive `bias` parameter applied to every segment's
  `p_vaddr`.
- **Found the hard way, why a fixed link-time base doesn't work**: musl's own self-relocation
  bootstrap always computes `real_addr = AT_BASE + stored_value`, expecting `stored_value` already
  zero-based — a fixed-base link double-counts the base. Fixed by linking `libc.so` at its own
  natural near-zero base and applying the real bias in `elf::load` instead.
  `INTERP_LOAD_BASE = 0xc000000` — one fixed VA, nothing here needs more than one interpreter
  resident at once.
- `do_execve` loads the interpreter alongside the main binary when a `PT_INTERP` segment is
  present, both sharing the same fresh address space; the real jump target becomes the
  interpreter's entry point.
- **A permissive `SYS_MPROTECT=492` stub** — `ld.so`'s RELRO step calls real `mprotect`, so it
  needed to stop `ENOSYS`ing, but enforces nothing yet (no W^X anywhere in this kernel).
- Verified end-to-end via `tests/dynlink_syscall_smoke.rs` — real self-relocation, real symbol
  resolution against `libc.so`, a real libc call, all round-trip correctly.
- **Milestone 2, not started**: `dlopen`/`dlsym`/`dlclose`/`dlerror` — blocked on `mmap`/`mprotect`
  actually enforcing real placement/protection (both still permissive no-ops/bump-allocators).

## Real getrandom/sysinfo/sigaltstack/pause/sigsuspend/POSIX timers/POSIX message queues/SysV IPC (`modules/posix_compat`, `modules/signal`, `modules/clock`, `src/fs/{mqueue,sysv_msg,sysv_sem,sysv_shm,sysv_ipc}.rs`)

A 28-syscall batch (`526`-`553`) pre-reserved with permanent invented numbers ahead of having real
handlers (see `docs/MISSING_POSIX_SYSCALLS.md`'s "Pre-reserved" section for why). All 28 now have
real handlers, landed roughly in POSIX/SysV order except SysV IPC landed message queues before
semaphores before shared memory (each needed progressively more novel machinery).

- **`getrandom`** (`526`): thin plumbing to `src/random.rs`'s existing generator. Only reachable
  via `getentropy()` in this port's roster, which caps `len` at 256 and loops — this handler
  always fills the whole request in one shot so that loop exits after one iteration.
- **`sysinfo`** (`527`): `RawSysinfo` (368 bytes, confirmed via a direct C `offsetof`/`sizeof`
  probe). Real `uptime`/`totalram`/`procs`; `freeram == totalram` (no dealloc tracking); rest
  honest zero.
- **`sigaltstack`** (`528`): bookkeeping via `Process::altstack`. No signal was actually delivered
  at this stack's address until later (see `SA_ONSTACK` below).
- **`pause`** (`529`): first item needing a genuine new primitive — `BlockReason::
  WaitingForSignal` + `wake_if_paused`, checked-before-block/looped-after-wake (avoids lost
  wakeup/stale-block, the discipline every blocking primitive here follows).
- **`sigsuspend`** (`530`): reuses `pause`'s primitive plus a temporary `blocked_signals` swap.
- **POSIX timers** `timer_create`/`_settime`/`_gettime`/`_getoverrun`/`_delete` (`531`-`535`,
  `src/process/timers.rs`): `Process::posix_timers`, up to 8, relative/`TIMER_ABSTIME` arming
  against `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`/`CLOCK_REALTIME`, real overrun accounting, delivered from the timer
  IRQ handler. Not inherited by fork; disarmed by execve. Later extended to accept
  `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID`/`CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID` too (see "Three UNRESOLVED fixes").
- **POSIX message queues** `mq_open`/`_unlink`/`_timedsend`/`_timedreceive`/`_notify`/`_getsetattr`
  (`536`-`541`, `src/fs/mqueue.rs`): a separate name→queue namespace, real priority-ordered
  delivery, real bounded blocking send/receive, real `mq_notify`/`SIGEV_SIGNAL` via `do_kill`
  directly. `mq_close` isn't its own syscall — an mqd rides the ordinary fd registry.
  `mq_timedsend`/`_timedreceive` needed a musl call-site patch (5 real args packed into one
  register: high 32 bits = len, low 32 = mqd, since nothing here was redundant to drop the usual
  way). Later gained signal-interrupt support (see "POSIX conformance pilot" bug 2 below).
- **SysV message queues** `msgget`/`msgsnd`/`msgrcv`/`msgctl` (`550`-`553`,
  `src/fs/sysv_msg.rs`): integer-`key_t`-addressed, fd-less namespace (no `crate::fs::fd`
  involvement — a queue lives from `msgget` until explicit `IPC_RMID`). Real `ipc_perm` checks,
  real `msgtyp` selection semantics, real timestamps. A real bug found in testing: an early draft
  removed a matched message *before* checking buffer size, destroying it on `E2BIG` — fixed to
  peek length first (real Linux "too-big message stays queued" semantics).
- **SysV semaphores** `semget`/`semop`/`semctl`/`semtimedop` (`546`-`549`,
  `src/fs/sysv_sem.rs`): same `key_t`→id namespace, factored through a shared `sysv_ipc.rs`.
  `semop`/`semtimedop` apply a whole `sembuf` array atomically (simulate-then-commit-or-nothing).
  Real `SEM_UNDO` via `Process::sysv_sem_undo`, applied on process termination. A new
  `BlockReason::WaitingForSemOp` backs real `GETNCNT`/`GETZCNT` — a real bug found live: an early
  draft woke every blocked waiter on *any* successful op, breaking those counts' own accounting.
- **SysV shared memory** `shmget`/`shmat`/`shmctl`/`shmdt` (`542`-`545`,
  `src/fs/sysv_shm.rs`), the one sub-batch needing real memory-management plumbing: `shmget`
  eagerly allocates a fixed `Vec<PhysFrame>`, zero-filled once. **`shmat` is the real proof of
  shared memory** — every attach against the same id maps those exact same frames into the
  caller's own page table (`SHM_REGION_BASE = 0x_4000_0000_0000`). `shmdt` is the one syscall in
  this batch that actually unmaps on the way out (`Process::sysv_shm_attach` list). Real
  `IPC_RMID`-while-attached lifecycle (key unlinked immediately, frames survive until last
  detach). **Not inherited across `fork`** (a forked child's page-table entries already point at
  freshly-copied private frames regardless, since fork here is eager-copy not COW) — starts empty
  in a child, same precedent `sysv_sem_undo` established.

Closes the whole 28-item batch — see `docs/MISSING_POSIX_SYSCALLS.md`'s own per-item write-up for
detail this section only summarizes.

## Real preemptive scheduling (`src/process/scheduler.rs`, `src/cpu/interrupts.rs`, `src/cpu/fpu.rs`)

The scheduler is no longer purely cooperative. A process still leaves `Running` voluntarily
(`scheduler::schedule()`, unchanged) — but can now also be preempted:
`interrupts::timer_interrupt_handler` calls `schedule()` directly whenever it catches a process
executing ring-3 code and a quantum (`PREEMPT_QUANTUM_TICKS=4` ticks = 40ms) has elapsed.

- **Deliberately scoped to ring-3 only, not full kernel preemption.** Checked via the interrupted
  frame's CS RPL bits, not a software flag. Kernel/syscall/module code is never preempted
  (`IA32_SFMASK` already clears `IF` for a syscall's entire duration). This is the load-bearing
  scoping decision: user-mode code never holds a kernel `spin::Mutex`, so no existing critical
  section anywhere needed auditing for preemption-safety.
- **The mechanism is unchanged `scheduler::schedule()`, called from a new site** — no raw-asm
  timer entry point needed. Each process's own dormant `iretq`-bound interrupt-return sequence
  sits on its own kernel stack until picked again.
- **EOI is sent before the possible `schedule()` call, not after** — load-bearing: until EOI, the
  PIC won't deliver *any* further timer interrupt to *anyone*, freezing every `ticks()`-gated
  wakeup in the kernel permanently.
- **A real, previously-flagged correctness gap this closed**: `cpu::fpu.rs` never
  saved/restored SSE/x87 state across a context switch — fine only under cooperative-only
  scheduling (a syscall boundary already forces the compiler to spill any XMM state it cares
  about). Real preemption can interrupt at literally any instruction. Fixed via
  `Process::fpu_state` (`FXSAVE`/`FXRSTOR` on **every** switch, not just preemptive ones). A
  freshly spawned/forked process starts from `cpu::fpu::clean_state()` — a real CPU-reset image
  captured once via a genuine `fninit`+`fxsave` at boot, not a hand-guessed all-zero buffer (x87
  control word and `MXCSR` have real nonzero hardware reset defaults).
- **A real regression found by the full test-suite pass**: `sysv-sem-syscall-smoke`'s block/wake
  test assumed the old cooperative guarantee ("the waker stays Ready until its own next blocking
  point") — real preemption breaks that. Fixed in the test itself (bounded polling loops instead
  of one-shot before/after checks) — no other test in the suite carried this same assumption.
- **Verification**: full existing test suite passes under real preemptible execution. Not covered:
  real-world responsiveness/fairness under sustained CPU-bound load — manual-QEMU-only.

## Real-time signal queuing and kill/sigqueue permission checking (`src/process/mod.rs`, `src/process/signals.rs`)

Closes the Open POSIX Test Suite pilot's "Real-time signal queuing" blocker.

- **`SIGRTMIN..=SIGRTMAX` (`35..=64`)**, matching musl's own `sigrtmin.c`/`sigrtmax.c`; `32..=34`
  stay permanently unclaimed (real glibc/musl convention). `Process::sigactions` grew to
  `[SigAction; 65]`.
- **`Process::rt_queue: [Vec<QueuedSigInfo>; RT_SIGNAL_COUNT]`** gives each RT signal its own
  small fixed-capacity (`RT_QUEUE_CAP=16`) FIFO — a second `sigqueue`/`raise` against an
  already-pending RT signal genuinely queues (POSIX requires this; standard signals staying
  bitmask-collapsed is explicitly permitted).
- **`record_pending`** is now RT-aware and fallible: `sig >= SIGRTMIN` pushes/pops `rt_queue`,
  returns `Err(EAGAIN)` once full (the real documented `sigqueue(2)` errno). An RT signal's
  `pending_signals` bit only clears once its own queue is empty.
- **Real `kill(2)`/`sigqueue(2)` permission checking** (`has_signal_permission`): sender must be
  root or share the target's uid — checked by single-target paths, not group broadcast.
- **Verified**: pilot moved 40P/16F/8U/4UT → 52P/9F/3U/4UT across two passes.
- **A real, separate gap surfaced by this work, since fixed** (see "Real signal-stack chaining"
  below): `deliver_pending_signal` used to deliver only **one** signal per completed syscall, so
  code that unblocks several already-queued RT instances in one call only ever saw one delivered.

## Real ring-3 fault-to-signal delivery, and two mmap fixes (`src/cpu/interrupts.rs`, `src/process/fault_trampoline.rs`, `src/process/mm.rs`, `modules/oxfs/`)

Closes a much bigger standing gap the pilot's `mmap/11-2,11-3,12-1.c` FAILs happened to surface:
**`interrupts::page_fault_handler` used to reboot the whole kernel on any page fault, ring-3 or
not.** A wild pointer deref in any userland program took the entire VM down.

- **Real MPR-correct partial mapping**: `mm::do_mmap_file_backed` now only backs/maps
  `covered_pages = real_size.div_ceil(4096).min(page_count)` — the tail past a file's real
  (page-rounded) extent gets **no page-table entry at all**, so a reference there raises `SIGBUS`
  rather than silently succeeding against a zero page.
- **Real fault-to-signal delivery, from scratch**: `page_fault_handler` checks the interrupted
  frame's CS RPL — ring-0 is still an unconditional reboot, but ring-3 now resolves a real signal
  (`SIGBUS` for a reference into a live mapping's own reserved-but-unbacked tail, `SIGSEGV`
  otherwise) via `do_kill`'s self-signal path, then redirects to a real, kernel-authored,
  user-executable trampoline page (`process::fault_trampoline`, fixed VA
  `0x_1FFF_FFFF_F000`, mapped in every fresh address space).
  - **Why not invoke the handler directly from the fault handler**: `extern "x86-interrupt"`'s
    compiler-generated entry/exit exposes no Rust-visible GPR fields to set up a real 3-argument
    handler call. **Fix**: the trampoline is `mov eax, SYS_FAULT_PUMP (554); syscall; ud2` —
    redirecting `instruction_pointer` there forces a real `SYSCALL` through `syscall_entry`'s
    already-correct GPR capture; `syscall_dispatch` special-cases `SYS_FAULT_PUMP` like
    `SYS_SIGRETURN`, calling `deliver_pending_signal` directly. Default disposition (no handler)
    now cleanly terminates just the one offending process instead of rebooting the VM.
- **A real, separate bug found chasing `mmap/12-1.c`, not about mmap at all**: `open(O_CREAT)` on
  a brand-new path defers the real inode/dir-entry until first commit; `unlink()`ing before that
  commit found nothing to remove and silently no-op'd, then the deferred commit resurrected the
  name. Fixed: `OpenFile::Write` gained `unlinked: bool` — `oxfs_unlink` finding no dir entry now
  scans `OPEN_FILES` for a still-uncommitted matching fd and sets this flag instead of `ENOENT`ing;
  `commit_write_buffer` still commits real content but skips `dir_insert` when set.
- Verified via `tests/mmap_syscall_smoke.rs` (4 parts, 3 run in isolated forked children since a
  fault kills whichever process it hits). **Not covered**: `SA_SIGINFO` invocation from a fault;
  dynamic re-check of a grown file's size against an already-mapped region.

## Three more pilot fixes: signal-interruptible `nanosleep`, real `FD_CLOEXEC`, real per-process CPU-time clocks (`src/cpu/rtc.rs`, `src/process/timers.rs`, `src/process/signals.rs`, `src/fs/fd.rs`, `modules/oxfs/`)

- **Real sub-second `CLOCK_REALTIME`** — see "Real-time clock" above. Closes `nanosleep/1-1,2-1.c`.
- **Real signal-interrupts-sleep** — see "Real-time clock" above (`wake_if_sleeping`). Closes
  `nanosleep/1-3.c`.
- **Real per-`(pid, fd)` `FD_CLOEXEC`** (`src/fs/fd.rs`'s `CLOEXEC` set): `F_GETFD`/`F_SETFD` used
  to be a pure no-op. Scoped per-`(pid, fd)`, not per-`real_fd` (POSIX: property of the descriptor,
  not the open-file description) — `dup`/`dup2` don't copy it, `fork_inherit` does. `do_execve`
  now calls `fs::fd::close_cloexec` — the first real close-on-exec behavior this kernel ever had.
  Closes `shm_open/11-1.c`.
- **Real per-fd access-mode enforcement on write/`ftruncate`/`fallocate`**
  (`OpenFile::Write::readonly`): `oxfs_open`'s create-path branch used to unconditionally produce
  a writable fd regardless of the caller's requested mode. **A real regression found immediately
  by the full test suite**: several existing userland smoke crates and `stsh`'s own `write`
  command called `open(path, O_CREAT)` with no explicit `O_WRONLY`/`O_RDWR` bit, relying on the
  old permissiveness — real, latent bugs in each, fixed by adding the missing explicit access-mode
  bit. Closes `shm_open/13-1.c`.
- **Real per-process CPU-time accounting** (`Process::cpu_ticks`): incremented by 1 on every timer
  tick where that process is the one actually `Running`. `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID`/
  `CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID` both read this (no real threading distinction needed — single
  "thread" per process at the time this landed). Closes `clock_gettime/4-1.c`.
- **Verified**: pilot moved 52P/9F/3U/4UT → 61P/1F/2U/4UT/0TO/0CR.

## Real signal-stack chaining (`src/process/mod.rs`, `src/process/signals.rs`, `src/syscall/mod.rs`)

Closes the pilot's last 2 (`sigqueue/4-1.c` FAIL, `sigqueue/8-1.c` UNRESOLVED) — both `sighold()` +
`sigqueue()` 5 times + `sigrelse()` (one syscall) + immediate check, with **no syscall in
between** the unblock and the check.

- **`Process::signal_stack: Vec<SignalStackFrame>`** replaces the old single-slot saved-frame
  field — `stash_signal_context` pushes an entry per `Handler`-disposition delivery instead of
  overwriting.
- **The chaining mechanism**: `do_sigreturn` now calls `deliver_pending_signal(frame)` itself
  right after popping/restoring an entry, *before* treating that state as final. If another signal
  is deliverable, it redirects `*frame` into that next handler instead of resuming — pushing a
  fresh stack entry, exactly like the first delivery did. Only when a `sigreturn` finds nothing
  else deliverable does execution actually resume. Same fix also closes the general "second signal
  during a *different* handler's execution" gap for free, since both paths call the same
  `deliver_pending_signal`.
- **Verified**: pilot moved 61P/1F/2U/4UT → **64P/0F/0U/4UT/0TO/0CR, 68 total**. Not covered: a
  bound on `signal_stack` depth (real POSIX doesn't bound it either; growth is already bounded by
  `RT_QUEUE_CAP`/bitmask collapse).

## POSIX conformance pilot expanded 68 → 488, plus real frame reclaim and five real bugs it found (`build.rs`, `src/memory/`, `src/process/`, `src/fs/{mqueue,sysv_shm}.rs`, `src/cpu/interrupts.rs`, `modules/oxfs/`, `modules/posix_compat/`)

Grew the pilot corpus from 68 files to 488 (every non-`pthread_*`/non-`aio_*` conformance
directory, deduplicated to one file per assertion-family variant — see `build.rs`'s
`POSIX_TEST_PILOT_FILES` doc comment for the corpus-selection methodology), then fixed five real,
independent kernel bugs the larger corpus's real fork/execve/signal/IPC traffic surfaced.

- **Real per-address-space frame reclaim, closing "no frame dealloc" for the common case** —
  hundreds of real `fork`+`execve`+`exit` cycles in one boot exhausted the heap around file ~140.
  `memory::BootInfoFrameAllocator` gained a real `FrameDeallocator` (an intrusive, singly-linked
  free list stored *in* the freed frames themselves — safe pre-heap-init by construction, unlike a
  `Vec`). **`AddressSpace::teardown`** walks and frees every `USER_ACCESSIBLE` frame beneath a
  discarded address space, safe because every page-table structure frame is always freshly
  allocated per address space, never shared, and fork is eager-copy, never COW.
  **`SHARED_LEAF`** (a repurposed PTE bit) marks the two real exceptions that *do* alias a leaf
  across address spaces — SysV `shmat` and fd-backed `MAP_SHARED` mmap — so `teardown` skips them.
  Wired into `do_execve`'s old-address-space discard and `do_wait4` process reaping. Also bumped:
  heap ceiling 128→1024 MiB, QEMU RAM 1024→8192 MiB, oxfs `NUM_BLOCKS`/`MAX_INODES`
  8192/1024→16384/2048, `test-timeout` 1800→7200.
- **Bug 1 — a ring-3 `#GP` rebooted the whole VM.** `general_protection_fault_handler` never had
  the ring-3 check `page_fault_handler` already had (found via `strftime/2-1.c`'s real
  stack-buffer overflow, correctly caught by musl's stack-protector `hlt`). Fixed with the same
  ring-3 → `SIGSEGV` treatment.
- **Bug 2 — `mq_receive`/`mq_send`'s blocking wait had no signal-interrupt path.** Fixed exactly
  like `pause`/`nanosleep`: check-before-block + a new `wake_if_mq_waiting` hook.
- **Bug 3 — real `futex(2)` doesn't exist, and musl's retry logic turns that into an infinite
  busy-loop, not a clean error.** `sem_timedwait` only treats `EINTR`/`ETIMEDOUT`/`ECANCELED` as
  real failure; anything else (including old `ENOSYS`) silently retried forever with no blocking
  syscall. Fixed with a minimal, honest failure stub: `process::do_futex` (real Linux's unclaimed
  `__NR_futex=202`) — `FUTEX_WAIT` returns real `ETIMEDOUT` instead of a fake `0`. `FUTEX_WAKE`
  just succeeds. (Real futex support landed later — see "Real threading".)
- **Bug 4 — a cross-process signal-default-terminate could panic the kernel via a stale
  scheduler ready-queue entry.** `do_kill`'s cross-process `Action::Terminate` branch, unlike the
  adjacent `Action::Stop` branch, didn't dequeue a `Ready` target from `READY_QUEUE` first — if the
  target was reaped before the scheduler popped that stale entry, `activate_and_prepare` panicked
  ("pid missing from table"). Fixed by adding `scheduler::remove_ready(pid)` into the shared
  `terminate_process` unconditionally.
- **Two pilot-corpus exclusions, not kernel bugs**: `timer_settime/2-1,6-1,9-1.c` block `SIGALRM`
  in-process, which also blocks `t0`'s own rescue alarm (only the three blocking ones excluded,
  not the caught-handler variants); `shm_open/23-1.c` forks 1000 unscaled children with no
  orphan-reaping mechanism on this kernel, permanently exhausting `MAX_OPEN_FILES=8` once its own
  parent dies to the rescue alarm — a structural limitation, not a bug.
- **Verified**: pilot needed 11 full runs to reach clean completion (`target/posix-pilot-logs/`
  holds every run's full serial output). Final baseline: **329P/62F/40U/8US/45UT/3TO/1CR, 488
  total** (the one CRASH is `strftime/2-1.c`'s own real upstream test bug).

## A real timer-signal wake bug, closing a fifth kernel bug the pilot found (`src/cpu/interrupts.rs`, `src/process/signals.rs`)

Found re-running the pilot after `clock_settime(2)` started succeeding for the first time.
`clock_settime/4-1.c` hung permanently past `t0`'s 40s rescue bound.

- **Root cause**: `interrupts::timer_interrupt_handler`'s two signal-expiry sites
  (`real_timer_deadline` and the `posix_timers` loop) only ever set `pending_signals` directly,
  never calling any of the four `wake_if_*` hooks every *other* delivery path already wires in —
  so a process genuinely `Blocked` waiting on a timer-delivered signal was never re-enqueued.
- **Fix**: made all four `wake_if_*` hooks `pub(crate)` and called them from both expiry sites.
- **Verified**: baseline moved 329P/62F/40U/8US/45UT/3TO/1CR → **373P/36F/22U/8US/45UT/3TO/1CR**
  (a broad swath of `sigwait`/`sigtimedwait`/`pause`/`nanosleep`/`mq_receive` tests gated on
  `alarm`/`setitimer`/`timer_create` flipped, not just the one triggering test).

## A real `siginfo_t` field-order bug, plus real `SA_ONSTACK`/`SA_NOCLDWAIT`/`SA_NOCLDSTOP`, plus a real preemption/ready-queue race (`src/process/mod.rs`, `src/process/signals.rs`, `src/process/scheduler.rs`, `src/process/lifecycle.rs`, `src/syscall/mod.rs`)

- **`RawSiginfo`'s `si_code`/`si_errno` fields were swapped relative to real musl x86_64** — a
  real bug present since the struct was first written (x86_64 never uses the MIPS-only swapped
  order). Silent because `SI_USER == 0` too. Found via `sigaction/10-1,11-1.c`'s
  `info->si_code == CLD_STOPPED`/`CLD_CONTINUED` check being permanently unreachable. Fixed by
  reordering the declared fields. **Three userland smoke-test crates hand-duplicate this struct**
  (no shared kernel/userland crate exists) and needed the identical reorder — found by re-running
  the full regression suite, not by inspection. **Any future wire struct duplicated this way needs
  the same audit whenever the kernel-side original changes.**
- **Real `SA_ONSTACK`**: `Process::on_altstack` + `begin_altstack_if_requested` (called by
  `deliver_pending_signal` before `stash_signal_context`); `SignalStackFrame::used_altstack`
  clears it at the right nesting level on `sigreturn`. Real `SS_ONSTACK` readback, real `EPERM`
  when changing the alt stack while genuinely on it.
- **Real `SA_NOCLDWAIT`**: `terminate_process` checks the parent's `SIGCHLD` flags and detaches
  the exiting child immediately instead of leaving an unreapable zombie. Self-exit (still running
  on its own address space) defers pid removal via the existing thread-reap queue instead of
  risking a live-page-table use-after-free — a narrow, intentional gap (one live exerciser).
- **Real `SA_NOCLDSTOP`**: `notify_parent_sigchld` skips `SIGCHLD` generation for the *stop*
  transition specifically when the parent's action has this flag set — a second, independent gap
  the `si_code` fix exposed (this test had always silently "passed" only because the earlier bug
  made its own check permanently false).
- **A real preemption/ready-queue race, found chasing a *flaky* hang**: `scheduler::schedule()`'s
  re-enqueue branch pushed the outgoing pid back onto `READY_QUEUE` without updating its own
  `state` to `Ready` — harmless before real preemption (this branch was only reached via a
  voluntary yield where the caller stayed `Running`-until-resumed), but real preemption now
  reaches it for a merely-interrupted process too, leaving a stale `state == Running` while queued.
  A cross-process `SIGSTOP` targeting that process failed its own `state == Ready` dequeue check,
  so it stayed queued while *also* marked `Stopped` — the scheduler later resumed it anyway,
  silently un-stopping it and stomping the state a subsequent `SIGCONT` depended on. Fixed at the
  actual source of drift: `schedule()` now sets `prev.state = Ready` before enqueueing.
- **`sigaltstack/9-1.c`'s missing `execl()` target**: needed cross-compiling and seeding
  `9-buildonly.c` (a real fixture the pilot's usual `-buildonly.c` exclusion rule wrongly also
  excluded) at its literal upstream-relative path — a pilot-corpus gap, not a kernel change.
- **Verified**: final baseline moved 391P/29F/10U/8US/45UT/4TO/1CR → **398P/25F/9U/8US/45UT/
  2TO/1CR, 488 total** (net seven fixes). Broad signal/scheduling regression suite re-run clean
  given how foundational the `schedule()` fix is.

## Real threading: `clone(2)`, `pthread_create`/`join`, shared address spaces (`src/process/`, `src/memory/address_space.rs`, `src/fs/fd.rs`)

Closes the single biggest foundational architecture blocker this project tracked — motivated by
real POSIX AIO, which both musl and glibc implement as pure userspace logic over a
`pthread_create` worker pool (no distinct kernel AIO syscall family exists on real Unix either).

- **Phase 1**: `clone.s`/`__unmapself.s` hardcoded raw Linux syscall numbers directly (same bug
  class as `vfork.s`, see musl-port section). Fixed: `clone.s` now targets a real reserved
  `SYS_CLONE=555`; `__unmapself.s` calls this ABI's real `SYS_MUNMAP`/`SYS_EXIT` directly.
- **Phase 2**: `Process::tgid: Pid` splits real `getpid()`/`gettid()` apart — set at both
  spawn/fork (never inherited by a forked child, a real process), untouched by execve.
- **Phase 3**: real `FUTEX_WAIT`/`FUTEX_WAKE` (`process::do_futex`, `BlockReason::
  WaitingForFutex(tgid, addr, deadline)`), scoped by `tgid` not raw pid (correct today since no
  ASLR means unrelated processes can share addresses like `USER_STACK_TOP`, and happens to be
  exactly right for `CLONE_THREAD` sharing). Unblocks unnamed POSIX semaphores for real.
- **Phases 4+5, the actual thread-creation prerequisite** — five changes to a kernel with no prior
  notion of two live threads sharing an address space: (1) `AddressSpace` → `Arc<PhysFrame>`-
  refcounted, `teardown` gated on `strong_count == 1`; (2) `ThreadGroupShared`
  (`cwd`/`root_inode`/`umask`/`uid`/`gid`/`brk`/`mmap_file_regions`) `Arc<Mutex<>>`-wrapped, shared
  by every `CLONE_THREAD` sibling; (3) `src/fs/fd.rs` keyed by `tgid`, not raw pid — real
  `CLONE_FILES` sharing falls out for free; (4) real `do_clone`/`SYS_CLONE=555` — `tls` read via
  the same raw-frame-access route `fork`/`execve` already use; (5) per-thread `SYS_EXIT` — a
  non-leader thread's table entry can't be removed inline (the scheduler still needs it mid-
  switch), so it's marked `Zombie` and deferred via `scheduler::queue_thread_reap`, drained at the
  top of every `schedule()` except the one still mid-switch off that exact stack.
  **Two real bugs found landing this**: `do_clone` must *not* call `fs::fd::fork_inherit` (real
  `CLONE_FILES` sharing already falls out from the tgid-keyed table; calling it anyway orphans
  duplicate entries and double-bumps refcounts); `terminate_process`'s whole-group-teardown branch
  must pass `tgid` to `close_all`, not `pid`.
- **Finish line: real `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID`** (`Process::clear_child_tid`) — needed for a
  genuinely unmodified `pthread_create()`/`pthread_join()` round trip: real musl's
  `__pthread_exit` routes `__thread_list_lock`'s release through a real kernel clear-and-wake at
  task-exit time, not a plain userspace unlock. Found via live per-syscall dispatch tracing.
  `terminate_process` now does a real write-zero-and-wake of `clear_child_tid` for every exiting
  thread, via a newly factored `process::limits::wake_futex`.

**Two real bugs found writing the raw-`clone(2)` smoke test itself**: a child's own new stack
must be `static mut`, not plain `static` (an all-zero immutable static gets placed read-only by
rustc); a hand-written `asm!` block must `setc` immediately after `syscall`, before any
flag-clobbering instruction.

**Verified**: `tests/clone_syscall_smoke.rs` (raw `clone(2)` proving `CLONE_VM`/`CLONE_THREAD`/
`CLONE_PARENT_SETTID`/futex-based join) and `tests/pthread_syscall_smoke.rs` (a genuinely
unmodified `pthread_create()`/`pthread_join()` C fixture). **What this unlocks**: POSIX AIO with
zero further kernel work; `pthread_mutex_*`/`_cond_*`/`_rwlock_*`/`_barrier_*`/`_spin_*` all
expected to already work (userspace logic over the same real `futex(2)`), not yet covered by a
dedicated smoke test. real `dlopen` stays **not done** (blocked on `mprotect` enforcement,
unrelated to threading).

**Named POSIX semaphores, since fixed** (`process::limits::futex_key`, `src/process/limits.rs`):
`do_futex`'s `FUTEX_WAIT`/`FUTEX_WAKE` used to key every wait/wake pair on `(tgid, addr)` alone —
correct for a *private* futex, but real `sem_open()` semaphores are `pshared` (real, unmodified
musl clears `FUTEX_PRIVATE` for them), meaning `addr` is a virtual address inside a real
`/dev/shm`-backed `MAP_SHARED` mapping that two independent `fork()`ed processes generally map at
their own, *different* virtual addresses (`NEXT_MMAP_PAGE`, `src/process/mm.rs`'s own bump
allocator, is one global counter shared across every process, never reset per caller) — so a
waiter's own `FUTEX_WAIT` and a waker's own `FUTEX_WAKE` almost never agreed on the same key,
permanently hanging `sem_open()`+`fork()` coordination (`build.rs`'s `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`'s
`sem_post/8-1.c`/`sem_unlink/{2-2,3-1}.c`/`sem_wait/7-1.c`). Fixed: a *shared* (non-
`FUTEX_PRIVATE`) futex now resolves `addr` through the caller's own address space to the real
physical address backing it instead — identical across every process mapping the same physical
frame, regardless of each one's own virtual address. A private futex is unaffected, still keyed by
`(tgid, addr)` exactly as before (still required on this no-ASLR kernel — see
`BlockReason::WaitingForFutex`'s own doc comment). **Verified**: `tests/sem_open_syscall_smoke.rs`
(a genuinely unmodified `sem_open()`+`fork()`+`sem_post()`/`sem_wait()` C fixture, `userland/
sem-open-smoke/main.c`), plus an isolated canary pilot run (`POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY=1`, see
`build.rs`'s own doc comment for this validation mechanism) confirming all four previously-excluded
`POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS` files: `sem_unlink/{2-2,3-1}.c`/`sem_wait/7-1.c` now genuinely `PASS`;
`sem_post/8-1.c` cleanly `UNTESTED` (it early-returns on `#ifndef _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING`
before ever touching a semaphore or forking — it was swept into the exclusion list by a proactive
pattern match, not an individually confirmed hang, and never actually needed this fix). All four
removed from `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`; a full corpus re-run to fold this into the pilot's own official
baseline hasn't been done yet.
Still not done: named POSIX shared memory (`shm_open`, a separate real cross-*process*
coordination path with its own gaps beyond futex keying).

**A real crash found chasing this, from a different angle** (`KernelStack::new`, `src/process/
mod.rs`): canary-testing `pthread_cond_broadcast/1-2.c` (a real `PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED` condvar/
mutex stress test creating up to `MAX_THREAD_CHILDREN = 10000` real threads at once) found
`KernelStack::new` hard-`assert!`ed on allocation failure — a single userspace process legitimately
exhausting the kernel-stack pool took the *entire kernel* down, not just that one `pthread_create`/
`fork` call. Fixed: `KernelStack::new` returns `Result<Self, ()>`; `do_fork_from_current`/
`do_clone` (`src/process/lifecycle.rs`) propagate a real `ENOMEM` instead (`do_fork_from_current`
additionally tears down its already-built `child_address_space` on this path — a real deep copy via
`AddressSpace::fork`, would otherwise leak; `do_clone`'s own `child_address_space` is a plain
`Arc::clone` via `AddressSpace::share`, so no teardown needed there). `spawn`'s boot-time call site
still panics — no syscall caller to report `ENOMEM` to that early. Same *class* of bug the "Real
zombie address-space frame reclaim" section above already fixed once, at a sibling allocation site
— `AddressSpace::new`'s own L4-table `.expect()` and the "out of memory mapping a user stack" site
in `lifecycle.rs` were the same shape and unfixed at the time — since closed, see this section's
own follow-up paragraph below. **A second,
unrelated bug this investigation also found**: `interrupts::timer_interrupt_handler`'s own
`[diag-thread]` per-process diagnostic dump (added for the thread-group-signal-delivery
investigation two sections up, explicitly marked temporary) did a full `O(table_len)` scan-and-
`serial_println!` *every 10 real seconds* — with hundreds to thousands of live threads, this alone
dominated a test's real wall-clock runtime badly enough to look like a permanent hang even after
the actual `KernelStack::new` panic was fixed. Removed (the `[diag] tick=table_len=` line itself
stays, `O(1)` per interval, still relevant to `fork/8-1.c`'s own open mystery below).

**The remaining two OOM-panic sites, since closed** (`src/memory/address_space.rs`,
`src/process/lifecycle.rs`, `src/process/fault_trampoline.rs`): `AddressSpace::new`/
`build_from_active` (the shared implementation behind `new_excluding_user`/`fork`) and
`copy_table_level` no longer hard-panic on frame exhaustion, matching `KernelStack::new`'s own
fix just above. `build_from_active`'s frame allocator bound tightened from `FrameAllocator` alone
to `FrameAllocator + FrameDeallocator`: a `copy_table_level` failure partway through a real
`fork()`'s eager deep-copy can leave the new child table holding a genuine, partially-built
subtree that must be freed before returning the error, or it leaks permanently. That cleanup
reuses `free_table_level` (already used by `AddressSpace::teardown`) directly, with no new walk of
its own — safe on a partially-built table because `child` is fully `zero()`'d immediately before
`copy_table_level` starts, so every entry it never reached is still `!PRESENT`, which
`free_table_level` already skips outright. `map_user_stack`/`fault_trampoline::map`
(`lifecycle.rs`) got the identical treatment, including distinguishing `map_to`'s own
`MapToError::FrameAllocationFailed` (real `ENOMEM`) from `ParentEntryHugePage`/`PageAlreadyMapped`
(real logic-invariant violations, still a hard panic — always-fresh VAs in a brand-new address
space, so hitting either means a future change broke that assumption). `do_execve`'s own three
call sites propagate a real `ENOMEM`; `spawn`'s boot-time call sites still panic, same reasoning as
every other boot-time allocation site. **Deliberately not addressed**: `do_execve` still has no
established convention for tearing down its own scratch `new_address_space` on *any* mid-build
failure (an `ENOEXEC` found partway through `elf::load`, for instance, already leaked the same way
before this pass) — the new `ENOMEM` paths in `map_user_stack`/`fault_trampoline::map` match that
existing (imperfect) precedent rather than inventing a new, inconsistent partial-cleanup discipline
for just those two call sites. Verified via `tests/fork_wait.rs`/`clone_syscall_smoke.rs`/
`dynlink_syscall_smoke.rs` (the real `PT_INTERP` path, `new_excluding_user`'s one exerciser)/
`mmap_syscall_smoke.rs` (forks into `fault_trampoline`-driven `SIGBUS`/`SIGSEGV` handlers) in an
isolated git worktree — the happy path is unaffected; the OOM path itself has no dedicated
regression test (would need a real way to force frame exhaustion on demand, not attempted here).

**A much bigger, separate discovery running a fresh full-corpus supervised pilot** (`scripts/
run_posix_pilot_supervised.sh --reset`), since root-caused and fixed: the naive "exclude whatever
file didn't get a classification line, retry" heuristic doesn't converge on this corpus at all. 23
iterations (~90 real minutes) each excluded exactly one file and stalled again almost immediately —
most of those exclusions were **wrong**: `pthread_atfork/3-3.c`/`pthread_attr_destroy/1-1.c`/
`pthread_attr_init/2-1.c` (all independently reconfirmed `PASS` in isolation earlier the same
session) got excluded anyway, because they merely happened to sit immediately after whichever file
actually broke the boot.

The trail: reading `supervised_iter23`'s own log showed `pthread_cancel/5-1.c` (real
`pthread_cancel(3)` isn't implemented) genuinely crashing with `CRASH(139)`, immediately followed
by the boot going silent for good. **First theory, disproven**: that this specific crash somehow
wedged the whole kernel. A dedicated isolated repro (`userland/pthread-cancel-crash/main.c` +
`tests/pthread_cancel_crash_smoke.rs`, reproducing `pthread_cancel/5-1.c`'s own exact scenario —
`pthread_join()`'s real `munmap()` of a joined thread's own stack, then `pthread_cancel()`
unconditionally writing through the now-freed handle) showed the crash recovering *perfectly
cleanly* — a real, unrelated binary ran fine immediately afterward. So the crash was a red herring:
the real manifest showed `pthread_cond_broadcast/1-2.c` sitting just seven files later, already
known from this same session's `KernelStack::new` investigation to stall with a suspiciously flat,
non-growing process table — the actual, silent (no `CRASH` line at all) stuck point, misattributed
to its more dramatic upstream neighbor the same way the wrongly-excluded `pthread_atfork`/
`pthread_attr_*` files were.

**Root cause, confirmed via `userland/pshared-cond-crash/main.c` + `tests/
pshared_cond_crash_smoke.rs`**: a real, previously-undiscovered bug in this project's own musl fork
(`third_party/musl`, commit `665bc49f` on the `oxidebsd` branch) — not a kernel bug. A minimal
repro (real `PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED` mutex/cond in a file-backed `MAP_SHARED` region) passed with
one forked child, and even with a concurrently-running second thread alone, but hung as soon as
**both** were combined: two or more real forked children genuinely contending the shared mutex,
forked from a process that already had a second live thread. A one-off `[diag-thread]` dump
(temporarily reintroduced for this one investigation, small process count so the earlier
performance concern didn't apply) showed both stuck children blocked on a real, *private*-scoped
futex at the identical address across both — decoded via `nm` to musl's own internal `ofl_lock`
(the stdio "open file list" lock), not any address of the test's own shared struct.

The actual bug: real, upstream `fork()` (`third_party/musl/src/process/fork.c`) takes a real
`LOCK()` on several internal locks, including `ofl_lock`, in the parent *before* the real fork
syscall, whenever the process is genuinely multi-threaded (`libc.need_locks > 0`) — real, correct,
unmodified musl behavior. But `_Fork.c`'s own `reset_stdio_locks_in_child` — **this project's own
earlier fix for a *different* permanent hang** (`fork/11-1.c`, see "POSIX pilot: full corpus
expansion" above) — unconditionally calls `__ofl_lock()` again to safely walk the open-FILE list.
The child inherits `ofl_lock` in a genuinely *locked* state (copied byte-for-byte from the parent's
own real lock acquisition moments before the fork syscall), so this second `__ofl_lock()` call
self-deadlocks immediately: the child's one surviving thread waits forever on a lock nothing will
ever release. Only reproduces with the exact combination this investigation found by bisection
(2+ real contending children *and* a real second thread already running at fork time) — the
`fork/11-1.c` fix's own original validation never exercised that combination. Fixed the same way
`fork()`'s own child-side atfork cleanup already treats every other lock in this exact situation: a
raw store back to unlocked immediately before ever trying to acquire it, since a freshly forked
child is always, unconditionally, the sole surviving thread — any inherited "locked" state is never
real contention.

**Verified**: the full N=10-children-plus-timer-thread repro, which hung indefinitely before the
fix, now passes cleanly; the existing regression suite (`fork_wait`, `clone_syscall_smoke`,
`pthread_syscall_smoke`, `sysv_sem_syscall_smoke`, `sem_open_syscall_smoke`,
`pthread_cancel_crash_smoke`, `mmap_syscall_smoke`, `dynlink_syscall_smoke`) all still pass after
the musl bump. `fork/8-1.c`'s own separate, still-genuinely-open CPU-timing mystery
(`POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`) is unrelated to any of this and remains unresolved. A fresh full-corpus
supervised run to fold this fix into an official baseline number hasn't been done yet.

**A real, separate staleness bug found auditing `build.rs`'s own exclusion bookkeeping**:
`pthread_atfork/3-3.c`/`pthread_attr_destroy/1-1.c` were marked "historical markers only, still
excluded in effect by the wholesale `pthread_*`/`aio_*`/`lio_listio*` prefix filter regardless" —
true when written, but that filter's own code was deleted on 2026-09-02 (the "POSIX pilot: full
corpus expansion" section above), and the two array entries were never revisited. Both were quietly
live-excluding two already-fixed, passing files for no real reason since that date. Separately,
`sigwait/4-1.c`/`timer_settime/{2-1,6-1,9-1}.c` turned out to be the same staleness class from a
different cause: all four share one shape (`sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, SIGALRM)`, arm a real timer,
`sigwait()` for it) exactly matching the delivery path "A real timer-signal wake bug" (above)
fixed — added to `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS` before that fix landed, never re-verified after. All six
confirmed `PASS` via isolated canary runs and removed. `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS` is down to two genuine,
live exclusions: `fork/8-1.c` (confirmed still genuinely stuck, unrelated to the `[diag-thread]`
fix above — needs a live dispatch trace, not more source-reading) and `sched_yield/1-1.c` (needs
real SMP). **Lesson for next time**: an exclusion-list entry justified by "some other mechanism
also catches this" needs that other mechanism re-checked to still exist, not trusted at face
value — the canary mechanism (`POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY=1`, see `build.rs`'s own doc comment) is now
kept as a standing regression suite covering all ten of these fixes plus the four `sem_*` ones, not
emptied out after use, specifically to make catching this kind of drift cheap going forward.
**Stale as of the next section below**: `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS` gained a third live exclusion,
`shm_open/23-1.c`, for an unrelated reason (a global-fd-table leak cascade, not a hang).

## A global-fd-table exhaustion cascade misclassifying hundreds of unrelated tests as `sigaction/1-N.c` FAILs, `MAX_OPEN_FILES` bumped, `shm_open/23-1.c` excluded (`modules/oxfs/src/lib.rs`, `build.rs`)

A full-corpus supervised pilot run reported 268 FAILs, 210 of them `sigaction/1-N.c` — wildly
disproportionate for a handful of small, previously-passing files. Isolating `sigaction/1-1.c`/
`1-2.c` alone (`POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY=1`) showed both cleanly `PASS`, proving the bug was
state-dependent on the full sequential run, not in signal delivery itself.

- **Root cause**: `modules/oxfs`'s `OPEN_FILES` table (`MAX_OPEN_FILES`, used for any write-mode or
  newly-created-file open) is a single **global** fixed-size array, not scoped per process. The
  pilot's own `shm_open/23-1.c` (real POSIX atomicity stress test: `NPROCESS=1000` children, each
  looping `NLOOP=1000` times calling `shm_open(name, O_RDONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, ...)`) never calls
  `close(fd)` anywhere in that loop — harmless on a real POSIX system, where fd exhaustion is
  scoped *per-process* (bounded by that one process's own `RLIMIT_NOFILE`), but on this kernel it
  permanently drains a table every other process shares, including **`hush` itself**. Once
  exhausted, `hush` can no longer open its own output-redirect file for the rest of the boot, so
  every later test — regardless of that test's own actual correctness — got misclassified as FAIL
  (`hush: can't open '/posix-tests/run-out.txt': No file descriptors available` on every line).
  Confirmed by rebuilding the canary list to the real manifest slice from `shm_open/1-1.c` through
  `sigaction/1-2.c`: the exact same cascade reproduced in isolation, with `[diag] tick=` showing the
  process table still growing rapidly right as `shm_open/23-1.c` hit its own real `TIMEOUT`.
  `close_all()` (`src/fs/fd.rs`, called from `terminate_process`) is not the bug — verified correct;
  the leaked children are still alive and running, not exited-but-unreaped.
- **`MAX_OPEN_FILES` bumped 8 → 256** (`modules/oxfs/src/lib.rs`) — a genuine, worthwhile increase
  in its own right (each slot costs `MAX_WRITE_BUFFER` = 128 KiB regardless of use, so 256 slots is
  a cheap ~32 MiB), but **not sufficient alone**: `shm_open/23-1.c`'s children keep running and
  leaking new global entries for a real, sustained stretch of wall-clock time (`sleep(1)` plus a
  random 0–20 ms `nanosleep` between each of 1000 iterations, times 1000 children) — confirmed live
  that even with the bump, running the same file far enough ahead of other tests (`timer_settime/
  {2-1,6-1,9-1}.c`, well past `sigaction` in the canary's alphabetical order) still hit the
  identical "No file descriptors available" cascade once enough wall-clock time had passed for the
  orphans to re-exhaust the larger table. A static bump only buys time against an unbounded leak,
  it can't fix one.
- **`shm_open/23-1.c` added to `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`** (not a hang — it correctly `TIMEOUT`s at
  `t0`'s own 40s bound, never wedges the boot — but excluded anyway since leaving it in a real
  full-corpus run cascades into misclassifying hundreds of unrelated later files regardless of how
  large `MAX_OPEN_FILES` is). The real fix for this class of test would be a genuine per-process
  (or per-tgid) fd quota — out of scope for this pass; noted as a known architectural gap
  (`OPEN_FILES` being global rather than per-process is otherwise invisible, since almost nothing
  in this corpus leaks fds at this kind of scale). Also dropped from the `POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY`
  standing regression suite for the same reason — keeping a permanently-excluded, unboundedly
  leaking file in that suite would fail its own downstream neighbors forever regardless of kernel
  correctness, not a useful signal.
- **Verified**: the real manifest slice (all `shm_open`/`shm_unlink` files plus `sigaction/1-{1,2}
  .c`, run in order) now completes cleanly with `sigaction/1-1.c`/`1-2.c` both `PASS` and no
  cascade; the full 64-file standing canary suite (all prior fixes plus this one) also passes
  clean, `table_len` staying flat at 2–3 throughout instead of climbing into the hundreds. Two
  narrow, unrelated, pre-existing FAILs surfaced once the cascade stopped masking them —
  `shm_open/39-2.c`/`shm_unlink/10-2.c`, both `ENAMETOOLONG`-for-`PATH_MAX` enforcement gaps
  neither `shm_open`/`shm_unlink` currently implements — noted as a follow-up, not fixed here. A
  fresh full-corpus supervised run to fold this fix into an official baseline number hasn't been
  done yet.

## Closing a real scheduler race and a real thread-group-leader signal-termination bug (`src/process/{mod,scheduler,lifecycle,signals}.rs`, `src/cpu/interrupts.rs`, `src/syscall/mod.rs`)

A fresh, `--reset` full-corpus supervised pilot run hit the same "naive exclude-the-stalled-file
heuristic doesn't converge" trap the `ofl_lock` investigation hit earlier — 7 iterations, 7
exclusions, every one landing in `pthread_cond_*`/`pthread_cancel`/`pthread_attr_*` territory (new
ground, since the `ofl_lock` fix only just unblocked reaching this far). Investigating the first of
these, `pthread_attr_setdetachstate/2-1.c`, found two real, independent, now-fixed bugs — one
scheduler-level, one signal-delivery-level — behind what looked like one flaky test.

- **Bug 1, the scheduler**: `interrupts::timer_interrupt_handler`'s ring-3 preemption check used to
  be `now.is_multiple_of(PREEMPT_QUANTUM_TICKS)` — a purely **global** tick-counter-phase check, not
  a per-process quantum. A process's actual remaining time before a possible preemption was pure
  luck (1 to `PREEMPT_QUANTUM_TICKS` ticks) depending only on where the global counter's phase
  happened to be when it started running, never on anything about that process itself. Real
  musl's `pthread_join()`/`pthread_detach()` against an already-`PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED` thread
  deliberately call `a_crash()` (see Bug 2) after reading that thread's own `detach_state` field —
  a field living inside the very stack mapping the detached thread's own exit path (`__unmapself`)
  unmaps out from under it, with zero synchronization (real POSIX documents this exact case —
  joining/detaching an already-detached thread — as undefined behavior). A real multi-core
  machine's own fast, tiny instruction window between `pthread_create()` returning and that read
  almost never loses this race. Under this kernel's single-core, QEMU/TCG-emulated execution, that
  same handful of instructions can span a whole 10ms tick, making a same-tick preemption to the
  freshly-created (and nearly idle) child land in the middle of that window a real, reproducible
  occurrence.
  - **Fix**: real per-process round-robin quantum. `Process::quantum_ticks_left` is set to a fresh
    `PREEMPT_QUANTUM_TICKS` every time a process is (re)activated to `Running`
    (`scheduler::activate_and_prepare`, and `schedule()`'s own "nothing else ready, same process
    keeps running" fast path, which bypasses that function entirely) and decremented once per tick
    it's found actually running; preempted at `0`. **The actual race-closing move**: `do_clone`
    resets the *caller's own* remaining quantum back to a fresh value right as its new child
    becomes schedulable — giving a thread that just created another thread a real, guaranteed
    window to finish any immediate follow-up work (like this test's own `pthread_join`/
    `pthread_detach` pair) before the brand-new child could possibly preempt it.
- **Bug 2, the real crash-or-hang mechanism**: real, unmodified musl's `a_crash()` (x86_64) is a
  raw ring-3 `hlt` instruction — a privileged opcode, `#GP`-faulting at CPL=3, converted by this
  kernel's own real fault-to-signal delivery (see "Real ring-3 fault-to-signal delivery" above)
  into a genuine self-`SIGSEGV`. That default-disposition termination path
  (`syscall::deliver_pending_signal`'s `SignalDelivery::Terminate` arm) called `do_exit` — a
  **per-thread**-only exit — instead of `do_exit_group`. If the crashing thread happened to be a
  thread-group **leader** with a still-live sibling thread (exactly this test's own shape: the
  main thread crashes inside `pthread_join()` while its own newly-created worker thread might
  still be alive), `terminate_process`'s `other_thread_alive` check saw that live sibling and
  concluded this was "just another disposable `CLONE_THREAD` sibling exiting" — correct for an
  *actual* non-leader thread (never an independent `wait4` target), catastrophically wrong for the
  leader itself, which is the *only* process a real `wait4()` is ever watching. The leader got
  silently marked `Zombie` and queued for full table-entry removal with **no**
  `wake_parent_if_waiting`/`notify_parent_sigchld` call at all — permanently hanging the parent's
  `wait4(-1, ...)`, whether the queued removal finished first (the pid vanishes outright, wait4's
  own children-list scan finds nothing) or not (an unreachable, never-notified zombie sitting
  there, since no second wake is ever coming). This is the **same underlying gap** `do_kill`'s
  cross-process `Action::Terminate` had too (a `kill(pid, SIGKILL)` on a thread-group leader with
  live siblings would hit the identical bug) — both were auditing the wrong function for a signal
  that must, per real POSIX, terminate the *whole* process, not one thread.
  - **Fix**: factored `do_exit_group`'s own "kill every other thread first, then this one" logic
    into `terminate_thread_group` (non-diverging, for a target that isn't necessarily the
    currently-running process — `do_exit_group` itself now just calls this then its own
    `schedule()`/`unreachable!()` epilogue). `deliver_pending_signal`'s `SignalDelivery::Terminate`
    arm now calls `do_exit_group` directly (a strict superset of `do_exit`'s own behavior for a
    genuinely single-threaded caller, safe unconditionally); `do_kill`'s three `Action::Terminate`
    call sites now call `terminate_thread_group` instead of `terminate_process` directly.
- **Debugging note**: found via three rounds of targeted `serial_println!` tracing (queue/drain
  events in the thread-reap queue, then `do_exit`/`do_exit_group`/`wake_parent_if_waiting`/
  `do_wait4`'s own entry points and decisions), not guesswork — the first theory (a pure musl
  detached-thread-exit race, unfixable kernel-side) was **wrong**; mapping a genuine ring-0 page
  fault's own instruction pointer back through the compiled test binary's symbol table (`addr2line`)
  is what actually located the real, fixable bug. All temporary tracing was removed once the real
  fix was confirmed.
- **Verified**: `pthread_attr_setdetachstate/2-1.c` now `CRASH(139)`s **deterministically** (matching
  real musl's own intentional `a_crash()` behavior for this exact undefined-behavior case — not
  something to "fix" further) and the pilot recovers cleanly afterward every time, across 9
  consecutive isolated canary runs (previously flaky: sometimes crashed cleanly, sometimes hung
  forever). Full existing regression suite (`fork_wait`, `clone_syscall_smoke`,
  `pthread_syscall_smoke`, `sysv_sem_syscall_smoke`, `sem_open_syscall_smoke`,
  `pthread_cancel_crash_smoke`, `pshared_cond_crash_smoke`, `mmap_syscall_smoke`,
  `dynlink_syscall_smoke`) still passes, including every fault-to-signal and cross-process-kill
  path this change touches. `pthread_attr_setdetachstate/2-1.c` added to the `POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY`
  standing regression suite.

## A fresh full-corpus run confirms the fix, plus four newly-found, genuinely distinct pthread hangs (`build.rs`)

A fresh `--reset` full-corpus supervised run, after the fix above, confirmed it working exactly as
intended: `pthread_cond_broadcast/2-3.c`/`4-2.c`, `pthread_cond_destroy/2-1.c`, and
`pthread_cond_init/4-2.c` (all separately flagged stalling in earlier runs, before ever being
individually investigated) now all either `PASS` or cleanly `TIMEOUT` (`t0`-rescued) — the same fix
closed all of them, not just the one file it was built against. All four added to the
`POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY` standing regression suite.

The run also surfaced a fresh cluster of stalls in `pthread_attr_setstacksize`/`pthread_cancel`/
`pthread_cond_timedwait` territory. Triaged each individually via isolated canary runs (not the
naive supervisor exclude-and-retry loop, which hit the same non-convergence trap as before —
misattributing a stall to whatever file happened to be running when the *build itself*, now over a
minute for this corpus size, ate into the supervisor's 120s stall-detection window before QEMU even
booted; `pthread_cond_timedwait/4-2.c`/`4-3.c`'s own transient exclusions during that run were pure
build-time false positives, not real findings, and were reverted). Verified findings:

- **`pthread_attr_setstacksize/2-1.c`**: a real, genuine, permanent hang — **not** another instance
  of the fix above. The worker thread's own `pthread_getattr_np()` call (a real GNU/NPTL extension)
  should hit a fast, syscall-free path reading its own already-known `stack`/`stack_size` fields;
  the fallback path (calling real musl's own `mremap()`-retry loop) doesn't obviously explain a
  permanent hang either, since `mremap` isn't even registered in this kernel's syscall table (an
  unregistered-syscall `ENOSYS` should make that specific loop exit on its first try, not spin).
  Root cause not yet found — added to `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`.
- **`pthread_cancel/5-2.c`**: a real, genuine, permanent hang, also unrelated to the fix above.
  Calls `pthread_cancel()` on a target thread in a tight loop for a full real second while that
  thread only ever spins on `sched_yield()` — never at a real POSIX cancellation point. Real musl's
  own `cancel_handler` (`third_party/musl/src/thread/pthread_cancel.c`) is *designed* to keep
  re-sending `SIGCANCEL` to the target via a raw `tkill` syscall in exactly this situation — a real,
  legitimate (if wasteful) userspace resend loop on any correct system, not itself a bug. Suspected
  but unconfirmed: something about this specific repeated real-time self-directed-signal-storm
  pattern (`pthread_kill`/`tkill` retargeting one specific thread over and over) trips a genuine
  kernel-side issue. Added to `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`.
- **`pthread_cond_timedwait/2-5.c`** and **`4-1.c`**: both real, genuine, permanent hangs — `t0`'s
  own 40s rescue alarm never fires for either (unlike every file the fix above actually closed,
  which now cleanly `TIMEOUT`). Structurally quite different from each other (`2-5.c` uses real
  `PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED` mutex/cond across multiple threads; `4-1.c` is a plain single
  `pthread_create`) — the one thing they share is calling `pthread_cond_timedwait` itself, the more
  likely common root cause than either file's own surrounding setup. `4-2.c`/`4-3.c` (same
  directory) remain unverified — each attempt to test them got blocked by whichever of these two
  hung first. Both `2-5.c` and `4-1.c` added to `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`; `pthread_cond_timedwait` itself
  is the most promising next investigation target, given it's implicated in two independent hangs.

## SIGCHLD delivery, real `sched_setparam(2)`, and four more mmap conformance fixes (`src/process/`, `modules/oxfs/`, `modules/posix_compat/`)

- **Real `SIGCHLD` delivery on child exit/stop/continue**: this kernel never delivered a real
  `SIGCHLD` before this. Found via `sigaction/10-1.c` (a `SIGCHLD` handler busy-waiting for
  `CLD_STOPPED` before ever sending `SIGCONT` — a stopped child became a permanent unreapable
  orphan once the parent died to its own rescue alarm, wedging the rest of the pilot run). Fixed
  with `signals::notify_parent_sigchld` (correct `CLD_EXITED`/`CLD_KILLED`/`CLD_STOPPED`/
  `CLD_CONTINUED` `si_code`+`si_status`, reusing `RawSiginfo`'s existing `si_value` offset), wired
  into every real child-state-transition point. Also fixes `hush`'s own `CONFIG_HUSH_FAST`
  short-circuit, previously dead since its `SIGCHLD` counter could never move. Pilot moved
  373P/36F/22U/8US/45UT/3TO/1CR → 391P/29F/10U/8US/45UT/4TO/1CR (`sigaction/10-1,11-1.c` now
  cleanly `TIMEOUT` instead of hanging forever — still blocked on the unimplemented `select()`).
- **Real `sched_setparam(2)`**: previously permanently stubbed `ENOSYS` in musl itself. Added
  `process::do_sched_setparam` + `SYS_SCHED_SETPARAM=507`. Second bug found the same session:
  `do_sched_scheduler` always returned `Ok(0)` on success, but real POSIX must return the *former*
  policy — fixed.
- **Four more real mmap conformance fixes**, closing `mmap/{3,9,14,18,19,21,28,31}-1.c` and
  `munmap/{3,4}-1.c`: (1) real `MAP_FIXED`/`MAP_PRIVATE` flags riding the wire (packed into
  `prot`'s unused high bits, musl patched accordingly) with real `EBADF`/`EINVAL` validation —
  previously the kernel guessed anonymous-vs-file-backed purely from `fd == -1` and ignored
  `MAP_FIXED` entirely; (2) real `mtime`/`ctime` tracking (`oxidebsd_unix_time` kernel export) plus
  real `mlockall(MCL_FUTURE)`/`RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` enforcement via `ThreadGroupShared`'s new
  `mlockall_future`/`locked_bytes`; (3) real `ENXIO` for an out-of-bounds nonzero-offset mmap
  request; (4) real `EOVERFLOW` when `off + len` exceeds `i64::MAX` (blocked by musl's own
  client-side `len >= PTRDIFF_MAX` guard, removed on the `oxidebsd` branch — **deliberately fixed
  even though real glibc+Linux fails this same test too**, since this project targets literal
  POSIX-spec conformance, not Linux-shaped behavior).
- **Verification**: `userland/mmap-syscall-smoke` extended with 8 further parts. Final:
  398P/25F/9U/8US/45UT/2TO/1CR → **414P/11F/7U/8US/45UT/2TO/1CR, 488 total**.

## Three UNRESOLVED fixes: a stock-musl `sigset` bug, real `timer_create` CPU-time clocks, and a same-process oxfs stat-visibility gap (`third_party/musl`, `src/process/timers.rs`, `src/cpu/interrupts.rs`, `modules/oxfs/`)

- **`sigset(sig, SIG_HOLD)` returned the wrong value on its first call** — a real bug in stock,
  unmodified musl (not anything this fork had patched before): it queried current disposition and
  returned that instead of `SIG_HOLD` whenever `sig` wasn't already blocked. Fixed on the
  `oxidebsd` musl branch (`6d311b99`): `disp == SIG_HOLD` now returns `SIG_HOLD` unconditionally
  once `sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK)` succeeds. Closes `sigset/6-1,7-1.c`.
- **`timer_create`/`_settime`/`_gettime` rejected CPU-time clockids with a flat `EINVAL`** — musl
  unconditionally claims `sysconf(_SC_CPUTIME)` is supported. Fixed by extending
  `is_cputime_clock` acceptance and arming/reading against `Process::cpu_ticks`. Closes
  `timer_create/10-1,11-1.c`.
- **A same-process `stat()` couldn't see a file its own still-open `O_CREAT` fd had just
  created**: oxfs defers the real inode/dir-entry insert until commit; `force_commit_pending_
  create` (already existed for `oxfs_open`'s own lookup) was never wired into
  `resolve_path_impl` — the shared resolver every *other* path-based syscall uses. Fixed by
  calling it once per path component inside that walk. **Not a plain PASS once fixed** —
  `mmap/13-1.c` then reaches its real assertion and correctly FAILs (`st_atime` is a permanent
  honest-`0` placeholder; real glibc+Linux fails this identical test for the same underlying
  reason per the suite's own `coverage.txt`) — a correctness improvement over the prior false
  `UNRESOLVED`, not a regression.
- **`sched_setparam/9-1,10-1.c` — investigated, not resolved.** Both fork real `SCHED_FIFO`
  children expecting real preemption on `sched_setparam()`, observed via SysV shm. Nothing in
  `do_sched_setparam`/permission checks/`sysconf` looked broken for the single-core root-uid case;
  needs a live dispatch trace to pin down, not more source-reading.
- **Verified**: 414P/11F/7U/8US/45UT/2TO/1CR → **420P/10F/2U/8US/45UT/2TO/1CR, 488 total**.

## POSIX pilot: full corpus expansion, real thread-group signal delivery, `exit_group(2)`, two real musl `fork()` bugs (`build.rs`, `src/process/`, `third_party/musl`)

Grew the pilot from the 488-file curated/deduplicated subset above to the **full Open POSIX Test
Suite corpus** (~1700 files in `conformance/interfaces/`, `pthread_*`/`aio_*`/`lio_listio*` included
now that real threading exists — see "Real threading" above): `discover_posix_test_files` walks the
directory dynamically instead of a hand-curated file list; the build loop is best-effort
(skip+log, not panic) since not every file cross-compiles clean; every pilot binary shares one
fixed load address instead of a unique slot each (the old per-file scheme ran out of VA room past
~700 files); oxfs `NUM_BLOCKS`/`MAX_INODES`/`NAME_MAX` bumped again (65536/8192/40) for the larger,
longer-named corpus; the kernel's own low-VA family shifted `+0x4000000` (third time this exact
"embedded corpus grew past the fixed load-base floor" class of bug has hit — see the userland
load-base note above).

**Reliability fixes needed to get real threading's own test directories past a permanent hang**,
found via a `[diag-thread]` per-process diagnostic dump added to `timer_interrupt_handler`
(pid/tgid/state/pending/blocked/preempted_resume, printed alongside the existing periodic `[diag]
tick=` line) rather than live GDB — each a genuine, independent kernel or musl bug, not one root
cause:

- **Real thread-group-wide signal delivery had two bugs**, both in `process::signals`: (1)
  `resolve_signal_recipient`'s fallback preferred the literal thread-group leader when no sibling
  had reached its own `sigwait()` yet — since the leader itself never sigwaits, a signal aimed at
  the group sat pending-but-blocked on it forever; fixed to prefer any *other* live group member,
  relying on `do_sigtimedwait`'s own check-before-block loop to consume it once that sibling
  arrives. (2) The whole-group reroute fired unconditionally on every `kill`/`sigqueue`, including
  a real `pthread_kill(exact_thread, sig)` (this ABI has no separate `tkill`/`tgkill` — it reaches
  the same code as a process-directed `kill()`, but must target *precisely* the named thread).
  Fixed via `route_signal_target`, gating the reroute to only fire when the literal target names
  its own group's leader. Also fixed in the same pass: `fault_trampoline`'s `mov eax,
  SYS_FAULT_PUMP` (see "Real ring-3 fault-to-signal delivery" above) permanently clobbered the
  interrupted process's real `RAX` before it could be captured — silently corrupting live
  computation on resume for any ring-3 process fielding a signal with no syscall of its own in
  flight. Fixed by stashing real `RAX` to a scratch slot on the trampoline's own page first.
- **A real, distinct `SYS_exit_group` bug**: `exit()`/`_Exit()` shared the exact same syscall
  number as a bare per-thread `SYS_exit` (a leftover predating real threading). A thread-group
  leader calling plain `exit()` only tore down itself — any still-running sibling thread was
  silently orphaned, and later deadlocked in its own `pthread_exit()` cleanup
  (`__tl_lock()`/`__thread_list_lock`) against musl's userspace thread-list bookkeeping, whose
  invariants assume a real `exit_group` already unlinked the leader atomically. Fixed with a
  genuinely distinct `SYS_EXIT_GROUP=556` (`process::do_exit_group`, kills every other tgid member
  first, then the caller) plus a matching `__NR_exit_group` remap on the musl fork.
- **Two real, independent, stock-musl bugs (not kernel bugs) behind `fork/11-1.c`'s permanent
  hang** — found by decoding the exact futex-wait addresses against the compiled test binary's own
  symbol table (`nm` + manual `struct _IO_FILE` offset math), not guesswork: (1) `_Fork()`'s
  `__post_Fork` reset the surviving thread's own `tid`/`__thread_list_lock` in the child but never
  touched any `FILE`'s own `.lock` word — a `flockfile(stdout)` held by the parent before `fork()`
  left `stdout`'s lock word holding a "ghost" tid in the child's eager-copied memory, unrecoverable
  by any thread there (real glibc avoids this via its own `pthread_atfork`-registered
  `_IO_list_resetlock`; stock musl has no equivalent). Fixed by resetting every known `FILE`'s lock
  in `__post_Fork`'s child branch. (2) Once fix (1) let the new thread lock `stdout` successfully, a
  second, fork-independent bug surfaced: that thread exits without ever calling `funlockfile()`
  (legal per POSIX), and musl's own `__do_orphaned_stdio_locks()` marked the lock with a poison bit
  instead of actually releasing it — permanently stuck, since nothing ever wakes it. Fixed to do a
  real release-and-wake, matching `__unlockfile()`'s own pattern. Both fixed on the `oxidebsd` musl
  branch. `pthread_attr_destroy/1-1.c` turned out not to be an independent bug at all: `fork/11-1.c`
  sorts first alphabetically in the sequential pilot boot and permanently wedged the run before this
  file ever got a chance to execute — once `fork/11-1.c` was fixed, it passed with zero further
  changes.
- **`ccache` wired into both the BusyBox applet build and the pilot's own per-file compile loop**
  (`build.rs`'s `compiler_invocation()` helper) — both already did a real rm-rf-and-rebuild-from-
  scratch on any musl core change (correct for staleness, but threw away enormous amounts of
  identical recompilation across BusyBox's ~232 applets). ~79% cache hit rate confirmed live on the
  next build; falls back cleanly when `ccache` isn't installed.

**The wholesale `pthread_*`/`aio_*`/`lio_listio*` prefix exclusion (~600 files) is now lifted** —
the full ~1673-file corpus (all of `conformance/interfaces/`, threading included) has been run to
completion. `sched_yield/1-1.c` stays excluded permanently (assumes real SMP fairness this
single-core kernel can't provide); a handful of `timer_settime`/`sigwait` files stay excluded for
reasons predating this expansion (see `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS` in `build.rs` for the current, authoritative
list — several entries there are kept only as historical markers of bugs already fixed, not live
exclusions).

## Real zombie address-space frame reclaim at exit, a host-vs-OxideBSD POSIX comparison, and supervised full-corpus tooling (`src/process/`, `scripts/run_posix_pilot_{supervised,host}.sh`, `userland/posix-conformance-driver/`, `build.rs`)

Running the full ~1673-file corpus unattended (`scripts/run_posix_pilot_supervised.sh`, a host-side
supervisor that kills a wedged QEMU boot and retries with the stuck file excluded, since a
kernel-level hang can't be rescued by `t0`'s own userspace `alarm()`) surfaced a real, reproducible
kernel panic partway through — `out of memory mapping a user stack` — confirmed via a supervised
multi-hour run hitting the identical panic site repeatedly regardless of which file happened to be
running when the shared frame pool finally ran dry.

- **Root cause**: this codebase never reparents an orphan to a pid-1 "init" (an accepted
  simplification — see `do_wait4`'s own doc comment), so any process whose real parent already
  exited (or simply never calls `wait4()` on this specific child) leaves a permanent zombie that is
  *never* reaped by anyone. Before this fix, `Process::address_space` was a plain `AddressSpace`
  (not optional) freed only by `wait4`'s own reap path — so an unreaped zombie pinned its *entire*
  address space (every mapped page, not just bookkeeping) for the rest of the boot. Many
  `pthread_*`/`fork` tests in the real POSIX corpus legitimately fork a child and exit without
  joining/waiting it (that's part of what they're testing) — across ~1673 files this compounded
  until physical memory was exhausted.
- **Fix**: `Process::address_space` is now `Option<AddressSpace>` — `None` only for a
  `ProcState::Zombie` whose frames have already been reclaimed; every other state always has
  `Some` (every live read site — `fork`, `clone`, `execve`, `mmap`/`munmap`/`brk`, `shmat`/`shmdt`,
  `activate_and_prepare`'s own context-switch activation — updated to `.expect()` accordingly,
  since a live/`Ready` process always has one). `terminate_process` now tears down the address
  space's physical frames **immediately at exit** (self-exit still has to defer the *teardown call
  itself* until `scheduler::schedule()` confirms `current_pid()` has moved off this exact stack —
  see `scheduler::ReapKind::TeardownOnly`, called via the same `queue_thread_reap` mechanism a
  non-leader thread's table-entry removal already used, now generalized to also do a real teardown
  rather than only a table-entry drop) — not deferred all the way to some future `wait4`. The table
  entry itself still survives in `ProcState::Zombie` either way, so a real future `wait4` can still
  find and report real exit status/rusage; `do_wait4`'s own reap path now correctly finds
  `address_space` already `None` in the common case and skips its own teardown call as a no-op.
- **A real, separate infrastructure gap found alongside this**: `posix-conformance-driver`'s
  harness only checked that `wait4` for `sh` returned the right pid, not that `sh`'s own exit
  *status* was `0` — a shell that silently died partway through the corpus (not a hang, not a
  panic — `wait4` still returned promptly) was reported as a clean "PASS" regardless, hiding the
  failure from every caller trusting that line. Fixed to also check `status == 0` and print the
  real wait-encoded status otherwise (see the syscall-ABI section's own note on `wait4`'s status
  encoding).
- **`scripts/run_posix_pilot_supervised.sh` hardened** to actually find every file standing between
  here and a clean run, not just hang-shaped ones: now excludes+retries on a real crash/panic exit
  (previously only a stall — a detected stall or the run exiting on its own without a clean PASS
  both now feed the same exclude-and-retry path), fixed a `set -e` trap where a bare `wait
  "$test_pid"` on a nonzero exit (a genuine crash, not a stall) used to abort the whole supervisor
  before it could log or exclude anything, added a duplicate-exclusion detector (excluding the same
  file twice in a row means the previous exclusion never actually took effect — most likely a
  `build.rs` `cargo:rerun-if-changed` mtime-granularity race with the very next `cargo test`, now
  padded with a real 2-second sleep — rather than a second genuine hang), and now caches every
  already-classified file's own result line (`target/posix_verified_results.txt`) across
  iterations so a long supervised run never re-executes a file it already has a real answer for
  (still counted in the final tally, just not re-run). `build.rs`'s own `POSIX_EXTRA_EXCLUDE_FILE`
  handling gained an **unconditional** `cargo:rerun-if-changed` (previously only registered when the
  env var was set) — found live: cargo's watch list for a build script is exactly whatever that
  script's *most recent* invocation emitted, so a single plain `cargo build` with the env var unset
  made cargo "forget" to watch the file, silently reusing a stale cached manifest on every later
  supervised invocation regardless of how many new exclusions the script appended.
- **New: `scripts/run_posix_pilot_host.sh`** — builds and runs the exact same vendored corpus
  directly on the host's own real glibc/Linux (same `t0`-wrapped 40s-per-file alarm, same
  PASS/FAIL/UNRESOLVED/UNSUPPORTED/UNTESTED/TIMEOUT/CRASH classification), for a genuine
  apples-to-apples comparison rather than a guess. Must run as root (`sudo`, in a real terminal —
  `sudo` refuses a password prompt with no genuine TTY, so this is manual/user-run only, not
  something to drive via the Bash tool). **Measured result, full ~1673-file corpus, both sides
  including `pthread_*`/`aio_*`**: OxideBSD **82.1%** raw / **85.6%** excluding UNTESTED, vs. the
  user's Artix host (glibc, native) **86.7%** / **89.7%** — a ~4-point gap. Notably, Artix has *more*
  raw FAILs (35 vs 27) and more real self-contained CRASHes (10 vs OxideBSD's genuine 6) than
  OxideBSD does; most of OxideBSD's gap is UNRESOLVED (38 vs 9, likely test-setup/environment gaps,
  not logic bugs) and UNSUPPORTED (131 vs 108, genuinely-unimplemented optional features), not
  correctness failures on paths that do run. The other 28 of OxideBSD's 34 counted CRASHes were the
  kernel-level wedges this section's own frame-reclaim fix targets, not independent bugs each.

## BusyBox gap analysis: what's needed for more applets

Almost everything left needs one of a handful of missing kernel capabilities, each unlocking a
cluster of applets at once. New syscall numbers should continue from the highest currently
assigned. `docs/BUSYBOX_APPLETS.md` is the authoritative per-applet detail behind this summary
table (counts are out of the 287 applets that built at all; a pre-v0.1 pass cut 58 of those 287
entirely — structurally incapable of working here, not "not started yet" — see that doc's own
"Removed before v0.1" section). 229 remain seeded.

| Gap | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `argv[0]` passthrough, real signals, process groups, termios/`ioctl`, `stat`/`fstat`/`lstat`, `getdents`/`getdents64` | done | foundational, all landed early |
| Socket syscalls + real DNS, `socketpair`/`fcntl`/`shutdown`/`set_tid_address`/`readv` + `/dev/{u}random,null,zero` + real `tcp_read` EOF fix | done | `wget` HTTPS confirmed live end to end — see "Real networking" |
| `alarm`/`setitimer` | done | unlocks `ping`'s receive-loop timeout |
| `chmod`/`chown`/`chgrp` | done | ext2 `ioctl`/`xattr` (`chattr`/`fatattr`/`lsattr`/`setfattr`) removed from roster before v0.1 instead |
| `fsync`/`sync`/`ftruncate`/`fallocate`/`flock`/`statfs`/`setrlimit`/sched-priority/`reboot`, `link`/`mknod`/`chroot`/`getrusage` | done | see their own sections above |
| SysV IPC, namespaces, `inotify`, ext2 ioctl/xattr | not started, 0 remaining blocked | the applets that needed these were removed from the roster before v0.1 — namespaces don't fit this kernel's single-address-space model at all |
| `/proc` (per-process, system-wide, per-fd) + real symlinks | done | special-cased path prefix in `modules/oxfs`, no VFS layer to plug into |
| Console/VT ioctls, serial/tape/I2C hardware, syslog, real pty | not started, 0 remaining blocked | `cttyhack`/`setsid` already worked and moved to WORKS; rest removed before v0.1 |
| Real block device driver + oxfs persistence, mount table | done | see "Real disk persistence"/"Mount table" — still a fixed, non-mountable backing store; `pivot_root`/`switch_root`/partition tables remain out of scope |
| uid/passwd-db model, real login/session auth | done | `adduser`/`chpasswd`/`passwd` still need real *mutation* of `/etc/passwd`/`/etc/group` (applet-level gap) |
| `clock_gettime`/`gettimeofday`/`time`/`nanosleep` | done | — |
| Init-system/service-supervisor framework | not started, out of scope | 2 applets kept anyway (don't need a real init framework); 4 removed (runit family needs FIFOs oxfs doesn't have) |
| `tcsetpgrp`/real job control | done | see "Real job control" |
| `uname`/`gethostname` | done | `gethostname` is a pure musl wrapper around `uname()`, no new syscall |

**83 more candidate applets didn't even build**: 54 need real Linux kernel uapi headers musl
doesn't vendor, 25 need a companion Kconfig option a single-symbol flip didn't resolve, 3 were
docs/example files mismatched by candidate-extraction, 1 (`lzopcat`) is a genuine link error. See
`docs/BUSYBOX_APPLETS.md` for the full breakdown.

## Closing two `pthread_cond_timedwait` hangs: a `terminate_thread_group` leader-ordering bug and real `FUTEX_REQUEUE` (`src/process/lifecycle.rs`, `src/process/limits.rs`, `third_party/musl`, `build.rs`)

Both `pthread_cond_timedwait/{2-5,4-1}.c` were real, permanent hangs (`t0`'s own 40s rescue alarm
never fired for either) left open by the previous session's scheduler/signal-termination work.
Traced each to its own actual blocking primitive rather than more source-reading; two independent
bugs, not one.

- **`4-1.c`** (a plain single `pthread_create`, no `PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED`): the worker thread
  calls a real `exit()` (== `exit_group`) after its own timed condvar wait, while the main thread
  (the real thread-group *leader*) sits blocked in `pthread_join()`'s own futex wait.
  `terminate_thread_group`'s loop used to kill every "sibling" (everyone but the caller) first,
  then the caller itself last — correct only when the caller happens to *be* the leader. Here the
  caller is the non-leader worker and the leader is one of the "siblings", so the leader got
  processed while the worker (the caller, not yet reached in the loop) was still alive —
  `terminate_process`'s own `other_thread_alive` check saw that and wrongly treated the *leader* as
  a disposable non-leader thread, silently stranding it with no parent notification (the same
  underlying failure mode `pthread_attr_setdetachstate/2-1.c`'s fix closed for the direct-call-site
  version of this bug, just reached via a different ordering inside `terminate_thread_group` itself
  that fix didn't touch). **Fixed**: every non-leader group member is terminated first, the leader
  (`pid == tgid`) always last, regardless of whether it's the original caller or one of its
  "siblings" — by the time the leader's own `terminate_process` call runs, every other real member
  is already `Zombie`, so `other_thread_alive` correctly reads `false`.
- **`2-5.c`** (100 threads, two mutexes, real contended condvar hand-off): musl's own
  `pthread_cond_timedwait.c::unlock_requeue` moves a waiting thread from the condvar's internal
  barrier word onto the mutex's futex word via real `FUTEX_REQUEUE` whenever more than one waiter
  is queued — `do_futex` treated that op (and `FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE`) as a silent no-op, so a thread
  already blocked in a real kernel `FUTEX_WAIT` on the old address had nothing left to ever wake
  it. Real `FUTEX_REQUEUE` doesn't fit this ABI's plain 4-register `SYS_FUTEX` wire format (real
  `futex(2)` needs 6 args for this op: `uaddr`, `op`, `val`/nr_wake, `val2`/nr_requeue in the
  timeout slot, `uaddr2`, `val3`). **Fixed** with a dedicated `SYS_FUTEX_REQUEUE=557` taking
  exactly the 4 real args the one real call site needs (`uaddr`, `uaddr2`, `nr_wake`,
  `nr_requeue`); `unlock_requeue` patched on the `oxidebsd` musl branch to call it directly instead
  of overloading `SYS_futex`. This kernel has no literal wait-queue data structure to requeue
  between (`WaitingForFutex` is a plain per-process block-reason, not a linked list) — "moving" a
  waiter is just overwriting its own `(scope, key)` fields in place, exactly equivalent in effect.
  Doesn't make `2-5.c` fully `PASS` (it now reaches a real `UNRESOLVED` from something else in its
  own giant pshared/altclock scenario matrix, not a hang), but it's no longer a permanent hang, and
  its previously-unreachable neighbors `4-2.c`/`4-3.c` — blocked from ever running by whichever of
  `2-5.c`/`4-1.c` hung first — both now cleanly `PASS`.
- **Verified**: isolated canary run (`POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY=1`) — `4-1.c`/`4-2.c`/`4-3.c` `PASS`,
  `2-5.c` `UNRESOLVED` (no longer a hang), full 73-file standing regression suite otherwise
  unchanged (52P/2F/1U/14UT/3TO/1CR). Both files removed from `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS`, added to the
  `POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY` standing regression suite. A fresh full-corpus supervised run to fold
  this into an official baseline number hasn't been done yet.

## Real per-process `times(2)`, and closing the last two `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS` entries from a prior session's pthread investigation (`src/syscall/ffi.rs`, `src/process/mod.rs`, `src/process/lifecycle.rs`, `src/process/signals.rs`, `build.rs`)

Continuing the same hunt as the section above: `fork/8-1.c`, `pthread_attr_setstacksize/2-1.c`, and
`pthread_cancel/5-2.c` were the three remaining entries from a prior session's "four newly-found
pthread hangs" list. All three closed — two were real bugs, one was never actually a hang at all.

- **`fork/8-1.c`**: `sys_times` wrote an unconditionally all-zero `tms` struct — the doc comment
  claimed "this kernel tracks no per-process CPU time at all," but that predated `Process::
  cpu_ticks` (added later, purely for `clock_gettime(CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID)`) and was never
  revisited. The test's child thread busy-loops forever on `while ((tms_utime + tms_stime) <= 0)`,
  which an always-zero `tms_utime` can never satisfy — a real, permanent hang, not the parent's own
  `do { ... } while (cur - start < CLK_TCK)` loop a prior session's own notes suspected (that one's
  return value, `ticks()`, was always real). **Fixed**: `sys_times` now reads real `cpu_ticks` into
  `tms_utime` and a new `Process::child_cpu_ticks` accumulator into `tms_cutime` (folded in by
  `do_wait4` at reap time — transitive, since it adds `child.cpu_ticks + child.child_cpu_ticks`, so
  a grandchild's usage flows up automatically). `tms_stime`/`tms_cstime` stay honest zero — no
  separate user/kernel split is tracked, same tier `cpu_ticks`'s own doc comment already
  establishes. `getrusage(2)`'s `ru_utime`/`ru_stime` have the identical latent staleness, noted but
  not fixed (nothing currently depends on it the way this hang did).
- **`pthread_attr_setstacksize/2-1.c` and `pthread_cancel/5-2.c`: neither was ever a real hang.**
  The original full-corpus supervised run's own "exclude whatever file happened to be running when
  a stall was detected" heuristic misattributed some *other* file's real stall to these two — the
  same failure mode `pthread_atfork/3-3.c` suffered before it (see `build.rs`'s own `POSIX_KNOWN_
  HANGS` doc comment). Confirmed by testing each in genuine, complete isolation
  (`POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY` narrowed to exactly one file) — both run to completion in seconds.
  `pthread_attr_setstacksize/2-1.c` reported a real, narrow `FAIL`: real, unmodified musl's own
  `pthread_create.c` rounds a requested stack size up to a page boundary and folds in TLS/TSD
  overhead before storing `stack_size`, so `pthread_getattr_np()` never round-tripped the *exact*
  raw `PTHREAD_STACK_MIN` this test requested. **Since fixed** on the `oxidebsd` musl branch — but
  only after confirming, live against the host's own real glibc, that this genuinely passes there
  (so it wasn't a bogus/upstream-broken test): `struct pthread` gained a `requested_stack_size`
  field, set once at real thread-creation time to the caller's actual logical request (or the
  implementation default), independent of the real allocator-padded extent `stack_size` still
  tracks for its own (unrelated) purposes. `pthread_getattr_np()` now reports the new field
  instead of deriving a size from `stack - stack_limit` — doesn't touch the actual stack
  allocation/layout algorithm at all, so the one real consumer of `stack_size` itself
  (`map_size`/`map_base` for `munmap` at join/exit) is untouched. Now `PASS`.
- **`pthread_cancel/5-2.c` surfaced two real, since-fixed kernel bugs before settling on a clean,
  bounded `TIMEOUT`**:
  1. **Signals `32..=34` (`SIGTIMER`/`SIGCANCEL`/`SIGSYNCCALL`) were wrongly rejected as `EINVAL`**
     in `do_kill`/`do_sigaction`/`do_sigqueue`. That range is "permanently unclaimed" only as a
     *libc-level* convention (real glibc/musl reserve it for internal NPTL-style machinery so
     application code doesn't collide with it) — not a real POSIX or Linux kernel-level
     restriction. Real, unmodified musl's own `pthread_cancel.c` genuinely calls
     `sigaction(SIGCANCEL=33, ...)` and `pthread_kill(t, SIGCANCEL)` through the exact same raw
     syscalls any other signal uses. Rejecting them broke real `pthread_cancel(3)` for every
     caller, not just this test — `init_cancellation()`'s own `sigaction` call ignores its return
     value, so the first visible symptom was always the `pthread_kill` call surfacing the swallowed
     `EINVAL` as `pthread_cancel`'s own return value (`UNRESOLVED` here). **Fixed**: widened the
     valid range to `0..=34`/`1..=34` at all three call sites. **A second, more serious latent bug
     this exposed before it could ship**: `Process::pending_siginfo` was only a 32-element array
     (`[QueuedSigInfo; 32]`), indexed directly by signal number — accepting signal 33 without
     widening this too would have turned a userspace `EINVAL` into a real out-of-bounds kernel
     panic at `record_pending`'s `proc.pending_siginfo[sig as usize] = info`. Fixed alongside (now
     35 elements, covering `0..=34` — real-time signals `35..=64` use `rt_queue` instead and never
     reach this array).
  2. **`sigaction()` disposition wasn't shared across threads in the same process** — a real,
     pre-existing threading gap, found once the range fix let `SIGCANCEL` actually reach the
     kernel: `Process::sigactions` lived directly on `Process`, not in the `Arc<Mutex<>>`-shared
     `ThreadGroupShared`, so each `CLONE_THREAD` sibling had its own fully independent copy —
     violating real POSIX (`sigaction()` disposition must be process-wide). `init_cancellation()`
     installs `SIGCANCEL`'s handler on whichever thread calls `pthread_cancel()` first, then
     `pthread_kill()`s the *target* thread — which, with a per-thread `sigactions`, still had
     `SIG_DFL`, so the target was unconditionally terminated (`CRASH(161)` = `128 + SIGCANCEL`)
     instead of the handler ever running. **Fixed**: moved `sigactions` into `ThreadGroupShared`.
     `do_fork_from_current` still builds a genuinely fresh `ThreadGroupShared` (copying the
     *value*, real POSIX fork semantics: a forked child is an independent process, never a thread
     sibling); `do_clone`'s own pre-existing `Arc::clone(&caller.shared)` for real `CLONE_THREAD`
     sharing needed no change at all to pick this field up automatically. Every direct
     `proc.sigactions[...]` access site across `signals.rs`/`lifecycle.rs` (9 sites) now goes
     through `proc.shared.lock().sigactions[...]`, respecting the existing "`PROCESS_TABLE` first,
     `ThreadGroupShared` second, never across `schedule()`" lock-ordering rule unchanged.
  3. **Residual, not chased further**: after both fixes, `pthread_cancel/5-2.c` settles at a clean,
     bounded `TIMEOUT` instead of any kind of crash or permanent hang. One thread genuinely
     livelocks in musl's own real `cancel_handler`'s `SIGCANCEL`-resend-via-`tkill` retry loop —
     intentional musl behavior for a target thread that never reaches an actual POSIX cancellation
     point (this test's own target spins on bare `sched_yield()`, which isn't one). Diagnostic
     tracing (`[diag-thread]`, temporarily reinstated for this investigation, removed after) showed
     the same thread `Running` with an identical `pending`/`blocked` signature across four
     consecutive 10-second snapshots — a genuine livelock, not forward progress. On real multi-core
     hardware the target thread's own userspace code still gets real scheduling gaps to notice
     `do_it==0` between resends; whether a resumed thread on this single-core kernel always gets at
     least one real instruction before an immediately-redeliverable signal redirects it again is a
     separate, deep scheduling question, out of scope for this investigation. A bounded `TIMEOUT`
     doesn't cascade into the rest of a full-corpus run the way an actual unbounded hang does, so
     this doesn't block anything.
- **`sched_yield/1-1.c` also turned out to never need SMP at all** — a real, long-standing
  staleness bug in this project's own exclusion reasoning ("assumes real SMP fairness this
  single-core kernel can't provide"), caught by simply re-reading the test's own source instead of
  repeating an old, never-re-verified claim across several sessions. The test forks `ncpu-1`
  CPU-blocking children specifically to *reserve* every core but one before testing
  `sched_yield()`'s effect between two other threads — on a genuinely single-core report (`ncpu ==
  1`, which real `sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN)` already correctly derives from
  `sched_getaffinity`'s real single-bit mask), that loop forks *zero* children. What's left is two
  equal-priority (`SCHED_FIFO`) threads round-robining via `sched_yield()` against each other — a
  real, single-core-achievable property, not an SMP one. Confirmed via an isolated canary run:
  clean `PASS` (a harmless `unrecognized syscall number 203` — `sched_setaffinity`, which the
  test's own affinity helper only `perror()`s on failure and continues past — doesn't affect the
  outcome). Removed from `POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS` entirely, added to the standing canary suite.
- **`POSIX_KNOWN_HANGS` down to exactly one genuine, permanent, deliberately-out-of-scope
  exclusion**: `shm_open/23-1.c` (an architectural mismatch between oxfs's 128 KiB-per-open-fd
  write-buffer design and this test's own 1000-concurrent-process fd-leak stress shape — a real fix
  means redesigning oxfs's write path to stop costing memory per open fd, scoped as a separate,
  future effort, not attempted here).
- **Verified**: full 77-file standing canary suite (`POSIX_PILOT_CANARY_ONLY=1`, all new entries
  folded in) — `55P/2F/1U/14UT/4TO/1CR`, exactly the prior 76-file baseline (`54P/2F/1U/14UT/4TO/
  1CR`) plus `sched_yield/1-1.c`'s own `PASS` — zero regressions. A fresh full-corpus supervised
  run to fold all of this into an official baseline number hasn't been done yet.

## Dependency notes

- `x86_64` crate: `default-features = false, features = ["instructions", "abi_x86_interrupt"]` —
  the default feature set pulls in `step_trait`, an unstable-API moving target that has broken
  this crate against newer nightlies before.
- `bootloader` pinned to `0.9` (not `0.11+`'s artifact-dependency API) — keeps setup in one crate;
  `map_physical_memory` feature is required for `BootInfo::physical_memory_offset` to exist.
- `linked_list_allocator`: `default-features = false` — its default `LockedHeap` depends on
  `spinning_top`, a second spinlock crate alongside `spin` (used everywhere else here).
- `pc-keyboard` 0.9's type is `PS2Keyboard<L, S>`, not `Keyboard<L, S>` (older tutorials reference
  the pre-0.9 name). Decoding is two calls through the *same* locked guard: `add_byte` →
  `KeyEvent`, then `process_keyevent` → `DecodedKey`.
- `pic8259`/`uart_16550` are deliberately **not** dependencies — both wrap a handful of
  `outb`/`inb` calls against a stable protocol, small enough that owning the code (`src/cpu/
  pic.rs`, `src/console/serial.rs`) outweighs the dependency. `pc-keyboard` (hundreds of lines of
  scancode tables) and `linked_list_allocator` (safety-critical free-list logic) stay external.
- `sha2`/`chacha20` (`src/random.rs`): `default-features = false`, `sha2` additionally needs
  `features = ["force-soft"]` and `chacha20` needs `--cfg chacha20_backend="soft"` via
  `.cargo/config.toml`'s rustflags — both otherwise try to compile a SIMD backend this target's
  disabled SSE/MMX can't lower. Crypto primitives are the one place this codebase deliberately
  prefers a vetted dependency over hand-rolling — the opposite call from `pic8259`/`uart_16550`
  above.
